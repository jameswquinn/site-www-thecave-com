        <h2><a href="/2007/05/18/product-website-or-company-website/" rel="bookmark" title="Product Website or Company Website">Product Website or Company Website</a></h2>

        <p>When I started White Peak Software 3 and a half years ago I lacked vision for what type of company <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/'>White Peak Software</a> would become. Over time visions developed and evolved into a single vision, to be a software vendor. During this evolution process I created multiple websites for White Peak Software. There is www.Killink.com for the <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv.aspx'>csv editor</a> released last month. There is www.SmtpDiagnostics.com for the first product released by White Peak Software, and there is www.WhitePeakSoftware.com, the official company web site.<br /><br />Each site shares a similar look and feel which provides some synergy between the websites. But I also felt it led to some confusion in branding.<br /><br />There are a number of reasons I took the approach of having product websites in addition to a company website. These reasons were based on advice read, heard, and given to me such as:<ol><br /><li>Having different product websites is better if products are unrelated.  Unrelated products can lead to confusion by the customer.</li><br /><li>Customers can be confused if your website offers both products and services.</li><br /><li>Customers might think you will drop support for a product if your product offerings are unrelated.</li><br /><li>Having a separate product site makes it easier to sell intellectual property rights to another company.</li><br /><li>A url such as www.myproduct.com might be easier to remember and type then the url for your company web site.<br /></li></ol><br />But after releasing Killink CSV I started second guessing the advice. To me it seems odd to have the multiple brands. It seems odd to push a product with its own brand while keeping your company name in the shadows. It seems odd one would want to start from scratch with a new website. After all improving a website&#8217;s page ranking and relevance within search engines takes a long time. It seems to me a new product would benefit from being marketed from the vendors existing company website.<br /><br />So I looked at the websites of various software companies which have been successful over the years. I discovered many of them have a single company website with multiple, unrelated products for sale. Here are some of the sites I looked at:<ul><br /><li><a href='http://www.techsmith.com/'>TechSmith</a></li><br /><li><a href='http://www.liutilities.com/'>Uniblue</a></li><br /><li><a href='http://ww.fogcreek.com/'>Fog Creek Software</a></li><br /><li><a href='http://www.sourcegear.com/'>SourceGear</a></li><br /></ul><br />These software companies sell multiple products including ones that are unrelated to one another. Some have registered the product name as a domain name, such as <a href='http://www.snagit.com/'>snagit.com</a>, that will redirect to the product&#8217;s home page within the company&#8217;s website. So if these companies are successful with only a company website then the recommendation that small software companies should have a product website and company website does not always apply, right?<br /><br />This research got me thinking a company website is better than having multiple product websites. But as I continued researching I found there is no one good approach. One approach is not better than the other. To use separate product and company websites or to have only a company website depends on the company. For instance it is probably better to have a product website separate from the company website when the company&#8217;s product is a web-base application. However for a company like <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/'>White Peak Software</a> having product websites and a company website doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense.<br /><br />The product website means more work. Branding gets confusing. Trying to promote the company brand with the product becomes more challenging, and leveraging the capabilities of the company website can lead to customer confusion. This is why I decided to consolidate White Peak Software&#8217;s product websites into the company website. This will help me promote the company name at the same time I promote the products. <br /><br />Google AdWords ads are a perfect example. Instead of seeing www.Killink.com in the ad you will see www.WhitePeakSoftware.com. The ad text still talks about <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv.aspx'>Killink CSV</a> but the company name now also gets additional exposure. More exposure is better than less exposure when building a business, right?<br /><br />So after spending a lot of time thinking about the pros and cons of product websites versus company websites, I decided to consolidate the related White Peak Software websites. In other words, I have eliminated the product websites and now have only the company website. The product website domain names are still registered and will remain registered. Surfers who enter killink.com or smtpdiagnostics.com will now be redirected to the product home page within the White Peak Software company website.<br /><br />This is partly a marketing experiment albeit one that will take time to determine the results. My hope is that consolidating the sites will help increase the company brand and encourage more sells. Time will tell if this indeed turns out true. Meanwhile I have the immediate benefit of having only one website to focus on improving instead of three.</p>

<p>The biggest new feature in v1.1 is the ability to read Excel files. This is huge in my opinion because it allows users to easily convert Excel data into delimited text using delimiters not supported by Excel such as the pipe character.</p>

        <p>Monday night my wife and I made a last minute decision to make a quick trip to <a href='http://www.killington.com/'>Killington</a> for one last day of snowboarding. Well, skiing for her. We hit the slopes yesterday and had a blast. But our 2006/2007 season has officially come to an end. <br /><br />This season turned out to be a great season for me despite the rough start. By mid-January I had far fewer days riding then I had hoped for or expected. New England wasn&#8217;t getting the early season snow it typically does. But in the end I got 32 days of riding and a few of those days included some of the best riding experiences I have ever had. Also, I can now say I have snowboarded in May and I snowboarded at least once a month for 7 consecutive months. Now if I can just get 40+ days next season&#8230;</p>

        <p>I received an email today from an individual asking if Excel files could be opened by <a href='http://www.killink.com/'>Killink CSV</a>. The person&#8217;s goal is to load the Excel file into <a href='http://www.killink.com/'>Killink CSV</a> and save the data to a pipe delimited text file. As far as I know this cannot be done in Excel, so guess what?</p>

<p>The next release of <a href='http://www.killink.com/'>Killink CSV</a> will support opening Excel files. I&#8217;m still in the very early staging of coding and testing but so far so good. This could be a useful feature for many. Load and convert your Excel data to a delimited text file without having Excel installed! Nice.</p>

<p>My only fear is that this feature might come back to haunt me. I know very little about Excel and I imagine each version of Excel has its own file format. I honestly don&#8217;t know yet. My tests so far have been limited to files created with Excel 2003. Time and testing will tell.</p>

        <p>I received an email today from a person interested in my opinion about Delphi 2007 and CodeGear. In his email he said he felt the Delphi 2007 release is not going as planned. He wasn&#8217;t sure if that was because the software sucks, support sucks, or what.<br /><br />I know experience and opinions can vary person to person, but I think Delphi 2007 rocks and I feel the CodeGear team is doing an amazing job despite a hiccup here and there. And to show more love towards CodeGear and Delphi 2007, here is my reply to the person&#8217;s email:<br /><br /><div class='quote'><br />I personally think CodeGear's Delphi 2007 is one of the best releases of Delphi in years.  I use the product on a daily basis and I have not experienced any major problems.  This latest release makes me excited to use Delphi again.<br /><br />The only serious problem I encountered was the ordering process but the problems were the fault of Digital River, not CodeGear or Delphi 2007.  The CodeGear staff responded quickly to the email I sent informing them of the problems.  Not only that, Loreen Fornshell of CodeGear went above and beyond to assist in correcting the problems caused by Digital River.<br /><br />There is still room for improvement with Delphi.  For example, the help system can use a bit more work.  But this initial offering from the newly formed CodeGear is not only rock solid (in my opinion) but shows that CodeGear is heading in the right direction.<br /></div><br /><br />Note: It occurs to me as I type this blog entry that the person might be referring to Delphi for PHP. I admit I do not share the same love towards Delphi for PHP as I do for Delphi 2007, but it is after all a version 1.0 product. Visual Studio 2002 and .NET 1.0 wasn&#8217;t that great either.</p>
