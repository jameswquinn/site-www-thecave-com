        <p>Lately I have seen a handful of developers blog the list of tools they use so I&#8217;ve decided to do the same. Here are the ones that come to mind because I use them daily.<dl>
<br /><dt><a href='http://www.eudora.com/'>Eudora Pro</a></dt><dd>My e-mail reader of choice.  I configure it for text base only so I don't have to worry about all the problems associated with HTML based readers.</dd>

<br /></dd><dt><a href='http://www.multiedit.com/'>MultiEdit</a></dt><dd>My text editor of choice and the tool I use to write small snippet code.  My only compliant is the lack of Unicode support, which prevents me from selecting MultiEdit as my IDE of choice.</dd>
<br /><dt><a href='http://www.devexpress.com/?section=/Products/NET/CodeRush'>CodeRush</a></dt><dd>Enhances the VS.NET editor with templates and other useful features.  Makes up for the fact that I don't use MultiEdit daily any more.</dd>
<br /><dt><a href='http://www.nunit.org/'>NUnit</a></dt><dd>I don't write a line of production code these days without first writing a unit test.  NUnit has changed my programming life.</dd>
<br /><dt><a href='http://www.tortoisecvs.org/'>TortoiseCVS</a></dt><dd>I gave up on VSS long time ago and exclusive lock source control.  CVS is a great repository and TortoiseCVS makes working with CVS repository a breeze.</dd>
<br /><dt><a href='http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/'>Reflector</a></dt><dd>This tool allows me to review the internals of an assembly.  The decompiler is great especially when working with generated code or trying to trouble shoot a problem with a 3rd party assembly.</dd>
<br /><dt><a href='http://nant.sourceforge.net'>NAnt</a></dt><dd>NAnt is an open source build tool that allows me to write build scripts in XML.

        <h2><a href="/2004/06/09/which-xml-api/" rel="bookmark" title="Which XML API?">Which XML API?</a></h2>

        <p>I had an interesting chat with a team member today about which XML parsing API from the .NET Framework to use for a particular situation. He mentioned that using the XPathNavigator with an XmlReader would not load the document into memory. However, after some quick research I found this to be incorrect. XPathNavigator is different than XmlDocument in that it is optimized for XSLT processing and the XPath data model, but it is similar in that the entire document is read into memory. XPathNavigator appears to use a cursor-base model for traversing the document while XmlDocument uses a tree-base model.<br /><br />The rule of thumb I have come up with is this: Read-only, forward-only XML parsing API tend to read from a stream and do not store the entire document in memory. Random access XML parsing API, which typically use a tree-base model or cursor-base model, will traverse in-memory the XML document which means this entire document is stored in memory.<br /><br /><br /></p>

        <h2><a href="/2004/06/08/making-the-move-to-test-driven-development/" rel="bookmark" title="Making the Move to Test Driven Development">Making the Move to Test Driven Development</a></h2>

        <p>I have been using NUnit since its early days but it has only been in the last six months that I have made the move to test driven development. TDD is concept of writing production code based on unit test cases that are written first. And using a framework such as NUnit enables the developer to write automated unit tests that will test the features of an application at a functional level thus encouraging test driven development. <br /><br />TDD is a paradigm switch for many developers as it was for me. Sure I have been unit testing my code for years. I would employ techniques such as console applications, shell programs, and other types of test harnesses to test the functions of my code. But until recently I never <br />started the development of a module by writing unit tests first.<br /><br />Test driven development is an investment up front in the quality of your code. That investment is in the form of the unit tests before production code. Many developers today write the production code first (after the design phase of course), followed by commenting the code, then followed by testing the code. And in many cases the later work of commenting and testing never happens because bug fixes become the developer&#8217;s top priority. But by investing in the quality of the code at the start developers will find that bugs are reduced, the classes and functions of the code are better designed, and over all quality of the work is greatly improved. Best of all, refactoring code becomes less of a risk with TDD because recursion testing at the unit level is possible.<br /><br />Here are some tip I would like to share that will hopefully help you make the move to test driven development:<br /><ul><br /><li>Just do it.  Force yourself to write your unit test first.  Over time the quality of the unit test will improve, writing unit test will be easier, and it will because almost second nature for you to start with a unit test.</li><br /><li>When testing data changes to a database, start a transaction in the SetUp of the unit test and roll back the transaction in the TearDown.  This provides an easy way to clean up the data after each unit test.</li><br /><li>Writing a unit test prior to writing the production code will give you insight into the design of your class or function.  Use this insight to improve on the design prior to writing production code.</li><br /><li>Use <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/blog.aspx?xml/2004_06_01_archive.xml#108613701548157152'>composite unit testing</a> to test implementors of interfaces.</li><br /><li>Write a unit test for each defect reported.  This provides a great way to ensure a problem never reoccurs.  And for those who already have existing applications but no unit tests, this approach will give you an introduction to writing unit tests.</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>I just read an <a href='http://reviews-zdnet.com.com/AnchorDesk/4520-7297_16-5138088.html?tag=adts'>article</a> about a new service called <a href='http://www.didtheyreadit.com/'>DidTheyReadIt</a>. In a nutshell, this service places a small Web bug in HTML formatted e-mails that acts as a tracking device. When the e-mail recipient reads the e-mail a script on the DidTheyReadIt site logs the action. It will even log how long it took to read the e-mail message. Based on logged information the e-mail sender can know if you read the e-mail or not. Fortunately this service only works with e-mail readers that support HTML formatted e-mails, which is something I have never liked. Unfortunately most people view e-mail message as HTML. <br /> <br />HTML e-mails look nice but too much can happen behind the scenes that the message reader does not know about such as tracking when the e-mail message was read. I use <a href='http://www.eudora.com/'>Eudora</a> as my preferred e-mail reader. It allows me to turn off viewing e-mail as HTML. I can still see the e-mail and read it, but it is not rendered as HTML. This means the e-mail message might not look as nice but it also means there is no unknown activity happening behinds the scenes when I read the e-mail. And I still have the option for view the message as HTML if I like.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2004/06/01/how-to-unit-testing-implementations-of-an-interface/" rel="bookmark" title="How to Unit Testing Implementations of an Interface">How to Unit Testing Implementations of an Interface</a></h2>

        <p>I have become a firm supporter of writing unit tests for most if not all code I write, and <a href='http://www.nunit.org'>NUnit</a> is an ideal framework for implementing unit tests. But one problem I have had repeatedly is finding a good way to test specific implementations of an interface. My approach has always been to write a new test fixture for each implementor of an interface. But the problem with this approach is that I end up duplicating unit tests for each implementor, and if I need to write a new test I have to copy it to multiple fixtures.</p>

<p>As a programmer I consider myself lazy. I don&#8217;t like having to write the same code over and over. Instead I would rather write it once and forget about it. Having to write multiple test fixtures for each implementor of an interface doesn&#8217;t suit my lazy style. I need a better approach and a quick google.com search pointed me in the right direction.</p>

<p>I came across a blog from <a href='http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/'>Jonathan de Halleux</a> that talks about <a href='http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/archive/2004/05/13/206.aspx'>composite unit testing using MbUnit</a>. Jonathan presents an approach that splits the testing effort by class functionality rather than writing a test fixture for each class. This is exactly what I am looking for but as much as I like this approach and MbUnit I still have one issue. I want an approach that works with NUnit and does not require another framework such as MbUnit.</p>

<p>The development environment I have created for my customer is solid and I do not want to introduce new problems by introducing a new framework, in the case MbUnit. In other words, I do not want to change what has been currently written including the NAnt build scripts. So I did the next best thing. I took Jonathan&#8217;s design and wrote a helper class to provide composite unit testing and include this class in my unit test projects.</p>

<p>Introducing CompositeTestFixture, a class that enables composite unit testing within NUnit test fixtures. Because this is a class and not a new framework there are limitations but the limitations do not affect the unit tests I am writing today. I will discuss the limitation later in this article.</p>

<p>To use CompositeTestFixture, begin by writing your test fixtures as you normally would. In the spirit of Jonathan&#8217;s blog I will show an example that provides a test for implementors of the IEnumerable interface. In this example I will show how to test the ArrayList and Hashtable classes which both implement this interface. The only requirement in this test is that the IEnumerable instance is not null.</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Diagnostics;

using NUnit.Framework;

namespace Samples.FunWithNUnit.MyClassLibrary.UnitTests
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class EnumerableTest
    {
        [Test]
        public void GetEnumeratorNotNull()
        {
            // Write unit test here.
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to write the unit test for the GetEnumeratorNotNull test. However we must first tell CompositeTestFixture about the factories needed to create an instance of class that implements the interface to test. I call the instance of the class the implementor.</p>

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
[ProviderFactory(FactoryType=typeof(ArrayListFactory),
ReturnType=typeof(IEnumerable))]
[ProviderFactory(FactoryType=typeof(HashtableFactory),
ReturnType=typeof(IEnumerable))]
public class EnumerableTest
{
    ...
}</code></pre>

<p>Next we need to write the code that will test the implementor. The NUnit framework is going to call the GetEnumeratorNotNull method that is decorated with the [Test] attribute. This is where we call into the CompositeTestFixture helper class. A static method RunTest is provided for those who do not want to create an instance of the CompositeTestFixture class.</p>

<pre><code>[Test]
public void GetEnumeratorNotNull()
{
    CompositeTestFixture.RunTest( this );
}</code></pre>

<p>Now we write the method that will perform the actual test. This method will have the same name as the test method. The only difference is that the method signature takes a single parameter of the interface type we are testing. Note that this method is not decorated with the [Test] attribute since we do not want NUnit calling this method.</p>

<pre><code>public void GetEnumeratorNotNull( IEnumerable en )
{
    Debug.WriteLine( &quot;Testing &quot; + en.GetType().ToString() );
    Assert.IsNotNull( en.GetEnumerator(), &quot;Must not be null.&quot; );
}</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s it. CompositeTestFixture will do all the heavy work of calling the appropriate unit test method to test a specific implementor.</p>

<h2 id='how_does_this_work'>How Does This Work</h2>

<p>CompositeTestFixture will reflect on the class instances provided in the RunTest method call and retrieve the collection of ProviderFactory attributes decorating the test fixture. Each factory declared by the FactoryType property will be called to create an instance of a class that implements the type defined in the ReturnType property. In other words the factory will be used to create an instance of an implementor.</p>

<p>A factory can declare one or more methods that return an instance object. I call these methods creators since each is responsible for creating a instance of a class. Having multiple creators gives the unit test writer the option to provide implementors that are initialized differently. For example one creator might return an empty ArrayList while a second creator might return an ArrayList filled with random numbers.</p>

<p>CompositeTestFixture determines creators by inspecting the factory class type and discovering each method with a return type that implements the type defined in the ProviderFactory.ReturnType property that decorates the test fixture. Creators must be defined with a public scope and no parameters on the method signature.</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections;

namespace Samples.FunWithNUnit.MyClassLibrary.UnitTests
{
    public class ArrayListFactory
    {
        public ArrayList CreateEmpty()
        {
            return new ArrayList();
        }

        public ArrayList RandomFilled()
        {
            ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
            Random rnd = new Random();
            for(int i=0;i&amp;lt;15;++i)
            {
                list.Add(rnd.Next());
            }
            return list;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>After CompositeTestFixture calls a factory creator it calls the unit test method matching the name of the [Test] method that invoked CompositeTestFixture.RunTest( this ). In our example this is the GetEnumeratorNotNull( IEnumerable en ) method. This is repeated for each creator declared on a factory and for each factory declared on the fixture.</p>

<h2 id='limitations'>Limitations</h2>

<p>Although this approach works for many cases it is not perfect. The SetUp and TearDown methods of the fixture will only be called when NUnit calls the wrapper test method. CompositeTestFixture does not call the SetUp and TearDown methods before and after calling the internal test method, although it would not be hard to add that feature.</p>

<h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>

<p>With the CompositeTestFixture helper class, I now have an easy way to provide composite unit testing within introducing a new framework into my development environment. Hopefully you will find this code as useful as I have. Click <a href='/downloads/CompositeTestFixture.zip'>here</a> to download the complete source code.</p>

        <p>This week at TechEd, Microsoft announced <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/default.aspx'>Visual Studio Team System</a>. It includes a number of features to get development team more into the life cycle such as unit testing, profiling, and code coverage. Sounds exciting but a couple of things I have read bother me. <br /> <br />Class diagraming will not use UML. Instead Microsoft has created a new notation which Microsoft says is needed to support two-way application design. The other point that I read that worries me is that Visual Studio Team System integrates tightly with SQL Server 2005. My assumption here is that as a team tool the database used most likely has to be a centralized database accessible by all team members. However, this is just an assumption at the moment but as a developer who uses a laptop and one who does development disconnected from a network from time to time such as when flying, I wonder how this will change the development experience or worse how it will limit the development experience. Guess I will have to wait until I get my hands on the bits to see what will happen.</p>
