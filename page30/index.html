        <h2><a href="/2006/01/13/smtp-diagnostics-review/" rel="bookmark" title="SMTP Diagnostics Review">SMTP Diagnostics Review</a></h2>

        <p><a href="http://email.about.com/mbiopage.htm">Heinz Tschabitscher</a> posted <a href="http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/gr/smtp_diagnostic.htm">a review about SMTP Diagnostics</a> on About Email.  I have to say I agree with Heinz when he says “SMTP Diagnostics does not help you understand or fix errors.”  It is true <a href="http://www.smtpdiagnostics.com/">SMTP Diagnostics will help you understand what is happening assuming you understand the protocol message</a>, but the tool would be more useful if it explained things in plain English, which I believe is Heinz’s point.</p>

<p>It’s been on my feature list for a while now to change this.  SMTP Diagnostics should provide more help and understanding in plain English.  The challenge has been to correctly interpret the error message.  For example, I recently was troubleshooting an email problem for a web application.  In my tests using SMTP Diagnostics I enabled SMTP Authentication and provided the correct credentials for the mail server.  For the From and To I used the same email address.  The sender was checked and determined to be okay but the recipient check failed with “550 no such user here”, and I knew for a fact that the email address was valid.</p>

<p>To SMTP Diagnostics the problem is clear.  The recipient address is invalid, or at least that is what it is told by the mail server.  However, the address is very much valid and the problem is actually caused by a check on the outgoing mail server that does not allow a message to be sent from an address to the same address where the domain name in the email address is different than the domain name for the outgoing mail server.  In other words, using this particular mail server you cannot send an email to validaddress@domain.com from validaddress@domain.com from a mail server at the domain anotherdomain.com.</p>

<p>The reason for the setting is clear.  The setting is used to help prevent spam mail.  However, it is impossible for SMTP Diagnostics to properly interpret this error into plain English that accurately describes the problem.</p>

<p>Another test on the same mail server further illustrates why it is hard to correctly interpret the actual error.  The same error message, “550 no such user here” is received for a valid recipient address when the From address used is not a valid maildrop but of the same domain as the outgoing mail server.  In other words, the mail server for anotherdomain.com will report “550 no such user here” for the recipient validaddress@domain.com when the From address no-reply@anotherdomain.com is used and no-reply is not a valid maildrop.</p>

<p>These are two very different scenarios where the mail server reports the same error message, and both result from server settings used to prevent sending spam.</p>

<p>Personally I’m glad mail servers are incorporating settings that help prevent spam mail from being sent.  But at the same time it makes it more difficult to determine the actual cause of the problem when sending outgoing emails.  Still, I plan to take the feedback from Heinz’s review and improve on SMTP Diagnostics for the next release.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2006/01/11/finalbuilder-is-a-must-have-for-constructing-build-processes/" rel="bookmark" title="FinalBuilder is a Must Have for Constructing Build Processes">FinalBuilder is a Must Have for Constructing Build Processes</a></h2>

        <p>For years I have relied on custom built build processes for software I develop.  For instance, on a recent large-scale .NET solution I used a combination of NTScheduler, VMware Workstation, CVS, NAnt, and the .NET SDK (along with other tools) to build an automated build environment.  However, doing something similar for every one of my software projects is time consuming, and I have to rely on different tools for different projects.  For example NAnt is useless for a Delphi Win32 project.  So I finally decided to give FinalBuilder a try.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.finalbuilder.com/">FinalBuilder is the ultimate tool for constructing a build process</a>.  Within minutes I was able to automate a build process for a box inventory program I am working on.  Of course projects with a more complex build process will take more than a few minutes to setup, but you should be able to automate a build process in minutes and not hours or days for most projects.  <br /><br />I’m amazed at the flexibility provided by FinalBuilder.  It supports a wide array of compilers and tools.  And it has an easy-to-use GUI for construction of the build process for every time of project I’m working on.<br /><br />I decided to see how long it would take to setup a build process for <a href="http://www.smtpdiagnostics.com/">SMTP Diagnostics</a>.  Although SMTP Diagnostics is a simple product, its build process involves a number of steps.  It is the perfect product to evaluate FinalBuilder with.  <br /><br />Here are the steps in the build process that I wanted to automate through FinalBuilder:<br /><br />- Create a build directory sandbox<br />- Retrieve the latest source code from <a href="http://www.cvsnt.org">CVS</a><br />- Compile the GUI program (using <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> 2006 compiler)<br />- Compile <a href="http://www.eurekalog.com/">EurekaLog</a> into the GUI program<br />- Compile to console program (using <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> 2006 compiler)<br />- Compile the licensing framework into the GUI and console programs (using <a href="http://www.siliconrealms.com/software.shtml">Armadillo</a>)<br />- Generate the help file system (using <a href="http://www.ec-software.com/hmpage.htm">Help&amp;Manual;</a>)<br />- Generate the installer (using <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>)<br />- Generate a zip file containing the generated installer<br />- Update and commit build number changes to CVS<br />- Tag release in CVS<br /><br />In less than 30 minutes I was able to setup the SMTP Diagnostics build process in FinalBuilder.  I can now make a complete build of SMTP Diagnostics in under a minute with a click of a button.  <br /><br />My next step in exploring FinalBuilder will be to generate the online help as HTML files and upon successful build of the product push the HTML files and the installer out to SMTP Diagnostics web site.  Given the time I spent playing with FinalBuilder, I’m confident I will be able to automate these steps as well.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2006/01/06/my-dead-or-alive-4-review/" rel="bookmark" title="My Dead Or Alive 4 Review">My Dead Or Alive 4 Review</a></h2>

        <p>For Christmas Melanie gave me a copy of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/d/deadoralive4/">Dead Or Alive 4</a> for the Xbox 360.  The game wasn’t released until the end of the December so I had to wait.  But it finally came in this week and last night I got a chance to play it.<br /><br />My review can be summed up in 4 simple words: My thumb is sore!<br /><br />I must have played 8 hours or so last night.  And yes my thumb is sore.  The game is awesome.  Story Mode can be frustrating at times but I was able to finish it in one night.  The frustration is not a bad thing although it seems like it when you are playing.  The AI in this game is incredible, which made Story Mode challenging and frustrating at the same time.<br /><br />Like other Xbox 360 games DOA4 supports leaderboards.  You can, for example, compare your best Survival Mode score against other players world wide.  My current ranking is around 10,500 out of 25,000 players.  I definitely need to work on improving that ranking.  <br /><br />As I have mentioned before, Xbox Live really makes Xbox 360 a great console.  Having the ability to compare my ranking and achievement to other players causes me to play more, and in turn leaves me wanting to buy more games.  Xbox Live is really the shining star of the Xbox 360 for the moment.  But this review is about DOA4, not Xbox Live.<br /><br />DOA4 comes with online play as well.  I played “Versus” challenges for a bit last night online.  Unfortunately I didn’t do as well as I had hoped.  There are some top notch players out there.  Online play was fun but the game play was a bit choppy.  I couldn’t tell if the performance problem was caused by my DSL line or if the problem was coming from the DOA4/Live servers.  I need to check the forums to see if other DOA4 players are experiencing the same choppiness.  I have not noticed any performance problems with other Xbox Live enabled games so I have to believe it is not my DSL line.<br /><br />Another feature I like about DOA4 is Sparring Mode.  There is a feature within this mode called Exercise, which is a great way to learn all the button combinations for a given character.  I will definitely spend more time in this mode to learn more of the advance moves and combinations.<br /><br />Overall, DOA4 is great.  The graphics are amazing.  The game play is fun.  The leaderboards are addicting.  And online play is a blast.  <br /><br />Thanks Melanie for getting me this great game.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The people - Sometimes there just too many people here.</li>
  <li>The traffic - I’m sick and tired of traffic so bad that it takes an hour and half just to drive 10 miles.</li>
  <li>The small apartments - I feel like I live in a shoebox at times.</li>
  <li>The high cost living - Rent is the worst.  I’m tired of paying more per month for rent than what a typical American pays monthly for on a home mortgage.</li>
  <li>Over priced beer - I have paid as much as $12 for a 12oz bottle of Bud Light.  And $5 to $7 is not uncommon.</li>

  <li>Bars and pubs - New York City has great places to hang out, meet people, and have a couple of cold brews.</li>
  <li>The energy - I still remember the first time I walked out of Penn Station and onto a Manhattan street.  I immediately felt the energy from the city, and I love that feeling.</li>
  <li>$2 beers - There’s nothing like finding a real deal in New York City.  And there’s a special feeling you get when you know where to find the $2 beers and can eat dinner for under $3.50.</li>
  <li>Living in New York City - There is no greater city than New York City in my opinion.  I’m definitely going to miss living here.</li>

        <h2><a href="/2005/12/25/long-time-no-post-3/" rel="bookmark" title="Long Time No Post">Long Time No Post</a></h2>

        <p>December has been a very busy month for me and my wife.  We’ve had a lot going on, which is why I have been slow to post this month.  And no, I have not spent the entire month playing on the Xbox 360, although I wish I had.<br /><br />First the exciting news…We’re moving out of NYC!<br /><br />Yep, you read it here first.  We’re moving out of NYC at the end of January.  Melanie and I both love this city but we also want a life style that is hard to have in the city unless you are filthy rich.  And contrary to my family’s beliefs, living in Manhattan doesn’t mean you are rich and we are far from rich.<br /><br />So where are we moving to?  <a href="http://www.salemweb.com/">Salem, Massachusetts</a>.  I call it our “From Rainbows to Witches” move and if you know anything about where we currently live and where we are moving to you will know this is not a Wizard of Oz reference.<br /><br />We found a super nice apartment in Salem.  It’s actually a house but a portion of the first floor is used as office space for the church that is next door.  We have a small portion of the first floor, all of the second and third floors, and a small storage room.  This house is definitely larger than our small Manhattan apartment.  And for a faction of the cost too.  I’ll post pictures of the house in about a month.<br /><br />A number of other things have been keeping me busy in December too.  Migrating all my Visual Studio.NET 2003 (.NET 1.1) projects to Borland Developer Studio 2006 (C# Builder) has not gone as smoothly as I had hoped.  I’ll post my experience about this later, but I will say I absolutely love BDS.  Live templates are awesome and the IDE is very fast.  Aside from load time I find it more responsive than Visual Studio 2005, which is why I’m moving all my .NET 1.1 projects to BDS.<br /><br />I also spent a lot of time in December reviewing and evaluating specific features of Visual Studio 2005 and .NET 2.0.  There are some improvements I like such as <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2005/11/09/my_opinion_of_typed_data_sets_is_changing.aspx">typed data sets</a> but I’m finding my customers are slow to move to or have little interest at the moment in .NET 2.0.  So while I wish BDS 2006 had support for .NET 2.0 it doesn’t look like I will be doing any hardcore .NET 2.0 work anytime soon.  My focus will continue to be on Win32 and .NET 1.1.<br /><br />Happy holidays to everyone.</p>
