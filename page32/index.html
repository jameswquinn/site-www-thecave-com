        <p>I recently changed the way perm links are generated for my blog entries.  However, I totally forgot about making the change to my RSS feed.  I guess that’s what happens when you introduce a technology like RSS and it runs problem free for months if not years.  Still, that’s no excuse for overlooking the RSS feed with regard to the new perm links.<br /><br />I will have a fix in place within a couple of days.  Sorry it can’t be sooner but my plate is full at the moment and since that has been no complaints it’s not a top priority issue.<br /><br />My apologies to those of you reading the blog through an RSS reader.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2005/09/02/convincing-a-client-it-is-time-to-refactor/" rel="bookmark" title="Convincing a client it is time to refactor">Convincing a client it is time to refactor</a></h2>

        <p>You know what I dislike the most about doing client work?  You see problems in the code, no bugs - things are working correctly, but the code itself is a problem.  Finding <a href="http://xp.c2.com/CodeSmell.html">code smells</a> for example, and you know the best thing to do is refactor the code to save tons of time in the future.  But some clients don’t get this and the ones that do get it will still say no to refactor work.<br /><br />You tell the client you want to spend a couple of days to refactor the code but the client says “No”.  To the client the code is working fine.  Refactoring is going to cost more money and require more testing while providing little benefit to the end user.  But the reality is ongoing maintenance cost for the code is going to cost more, which down the road could increase the cost to the end user, if refactoring does not occur.  What is often overlooked is that maintenance costs can be lowered in the long term as a result of a refactoring investment.<br /><br />Refactoring is something that should be embraced, not feared or viewed as an unnecessary cost.  Refactoring improves the quality of the code and reduces code maintenance in the future and thus reduces cost.  <br /><br />A joy I have in writing my own software is being able to make the refactoring call myself.  I don’t always say yes to refactoring but when the time is right I refactor the code.  I don’t concern myself with the initial refactoring and testing costs because I know it will save me time and money in the long run.<br /><br />So when is the time right?  That’s a hard question to answer because the right time can be different for each shop and software package.  For me a right time is when working on a new feature I find a number of code smells affecting the quality of the feature.  Assuming a refactor will only affect a small portion of the entire system and it will take no more than a couple of days to refactor and test the changes, I make the yes call to refactor the code.<br /><br />Do I worry about breaking existing functionality as a result of refactoring?  Absolutely, especially when refactoring occurs in a critical area such as processing a credit card transaction.  This is why it is so important to have automated scripts and unit tests in place.  Automated regression testing definitely helps ease concerns.<br /><br />So how do I convince the client it is time to refactor code?  I wish there was a magic answer to the question that could be applied to all cases but there isn’t.  Getting the client to okay a refactor takes having the client’s trust in your abilities and decisions.  <br /><br />One way to gain trust is to know when to recommend a refactor.  You should make a point not to scream “fire” each time you find code smells.  If each time you are asked to implement a new feature and you come back with “Before I can implement the feature I need to re-write all this other code,” your client’s trust in you will most definitely drop.<br /><br />You also need to be able to show the client the long term value gained by refactoring.  For instance, make the client aware of the various code smells and discuss the impact the repeated (or similar) code has to maintenance should a bug be found or a business requirement changes in the future.  Also, remind the client that the need is fresh in your head but 6 months later it is going to take more time research the impact.  Plus, the number of smells may have grown between the time the problem was first identified and the time code has to change, resulting in higher costs.<br /><br />Lastly, be mindful of the business side.  Many times developers only think of the technical aspects with no regard to the business side of things.  Understand what is happening on the business side of a project will help when discussing a refactoring effort with a client.  This can also help you understand why the answer is “No” and could help you identify a better “right time” to refactor.<br /><br />Convincing a client it is time to refactor is no trivial task but it is possible.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2005/08/30/date-range-check-in-sql-server/" rel="bookmark" title="Date Range Check in SQL Server">Date Range Check in SQL Server</a></h2>

        <p>I have been writing a number of stored procedures that return report data for a client.  Each of these reports can be filtered by a date range, so I needed a simple way to check that a date was within a user defined date range.  <br /><br />As an additional requirement, if the user does not specify a begin date or end date as part of the date range then the earliest or latest supported date respectively should be used.  In other words, if the user does not specify a begin date then the earliest date supported by SQL Server should be used as the begin date, and if the user does not specify the end date then the latest date supported is used for the end date.<br /><br />My original approach was to use a BETWEEN clause in the SELECT statements.  However, this made the code messy especially with the ISNULL call used to set the begin end dates when NULL.  So I swapped out the code with a user-defined function.<br /><br />The user-defined function <b>fnIsInDateRange</b> takes 3 parameters:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Date to check&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beginning date of the date range&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ending date of the date range&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br />The function returns one of the following:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<b>-1</b> if the date is before the range&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<b>0</b> if the date is within the range&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<b>1</b> if the date is beyond the range&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br />Here’s the code for those who want it.&lt;pre&gt;<br />CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fnIsInDateRange<br />/* <br />  Determines if the date time value is within the date time range.<br /> <br />  Returns:<br />  -1 if the date is before the date range.<br />   0 if the date is within the date range.<br />   1 if the date is after the date range.<br /> <br />  Usage:<br />   SELECT dbo.fnIsInDateRange(‘2005-08-16’,’2005-08-01’,’2005-08-15’)<br />   SELECT * FROM exams WHERE dbo.fnIsInDateRange(dtmExamDate,’2005-08-01’,’2005-08-15’)=0<br />*/  <br />  (<br />    @value      DATETIME,<br />    @rangeFrom  DATETIME,<br />    @rangeTo    DATETIME<br />  )<br />RETURNS SMALLINT<br />AS<br />BEGIN<br />   DECLARE @result SMALLINT<br />   IF @value &lt; ISNULL(@rangeFrom,'1753-01-01 00:00:00.000') <br />   BEGIN<br />      SET @result = -1<br />   END<br />   ELSE IF @value &gt; ISNULL( @rangeTo, ‘9999-12-31 11:59:59.997’ )<br />   BEGIN<br />      SET @result = 1<br />   END<br />   ELSE<br />   BEGIN<br />      SET @result = 0<br />   END<br />   RETURN @result<br />END<br />&lt;/pre&gt;</p>

        <p>I’ve always said I’m lazy programmer, which makes me a good programmer.  For instance, I’m too lazy to perform the same task over and over on a computer so I write a tool.  And I hate writing the same code over and over.  I would rather write it once, package it up in a library, and forget the details.  All I want to remember is the API.<br /><br />I also believe my lack of a quality education helps me think of solutions that smarter individual may never even consider.  My seemingly childish approach to problem solving helps me think of solutions to the most time consuming yet simple problems.<br /><br />But Philipp Lenssen at Google Blogoscoped has really summed up <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html">why good programmers are lazy and dumb</a>.  Give it a read.</p>

        <h2 id="lake-sunapee">Lake Sunapee</h2>

<p>Last week Melanie and I joined her family for a week long vacation on Lake Sunapee in New Hampshire.  Aside from no broadband Internet connection, the trip was perfect.  The house we rented sits just a few feet from the water on 1 of 3 natural sandy beaches at Lake Sunapee.</p>

<p>The views are amazing and the water is crystal clear.  Being from Memphis, the water was naturally a little cold for me but I was still able to get in the water.  We rented a pontoon boat for a day to tour the entire lake, and we were able to view the ski slopes of Mount Sunapee from the water.  I couldn’t help but think how cool it would be to snow mobile across the lake in winter time to Mt Sunapee and snowboard for the day.  Having a summer time house on Lake Sunapee would be awesome, but I imagine having a winter time house on the lake would be equally as awesome.</p>

<p>We didn’t sit around the lake all day, every day.  Melanie and I brought bikes with us and rode around.  Some of the hills were killers to climb but the speed coming down was exhilarating.  Our longest ride was one around the entire lake, which resulted in a 22 or 23 mile ride.  In the beginning, we didn’t think we could do it but next thing we knew we were back at the house.</p>

<p>I highly recommend Lake Sunapee for those looking for a New England vacation.</p>

<h2 id="salem-mass">Salem, Mass</h2>

<p>As many people already know, Melanie and I are considering leaving NYC.  Our life style has changed since getting married and we want certain things in our life that are hard to obtain in New York unless you have millions in the bank, which we do not.  We really like New England and will probably end up somewhere North of Boston.  Salem, MA is one of the areas we are considering so we stopped by the town on our drive back to NYC from Lake Sunapee.</p>

<p>The day was hot, very hot.  The temperature was around 95 degrees, which is way too hot for me.  We had lunch at an Irish pub then walked around Salem Commons.  Salem is definitely our favor place in the North of Boston area at the moment.  We’re planning more visits to the area this fall before making our final decision but the closeness to Vermont and New Hampshire, and the coolness of this water front town has us already dreaming of “Going from Rainbows to Witches.”</p>

<h2 id="dci">DCI</h2>

<p>Our vacation week ended with a stop to Gillett Stadium in Foxborough, MA, home of the New England Patriots, to see the <a href="http://www.dci.org/">DCI</a> World Championships.  This was my first DCI event in many years and Melanie’s first DCI event ever.  Blue Knights, Santa Clara Vanguard, and The Cavaliers were our favorites of the night.  While The Cadets took home the championship with a score of 99.150, I personally believe The Cavaliers were far better.  And granted I don’t know the judging rules as well as I did 20 years ago but how can a corp score 99.150 when the drum major starts the show before the judges indicated that they were ready.</p>

<p>Short story short, The Cadet’s drum major started the show before the announcer asked if the judges were ready, which is before the drum major is asked if he or she is ready, and is most definitely before the announcer tells the corp that they may take the field.  But what do I know?  Heck, I thought The Cavaliers were way better but they only scored a 97.625 putting them in second place for the night.</p>
