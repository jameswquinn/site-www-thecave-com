        <h2><a href="/2006/05/05/dbgo-and-delphi/" rel="bookmark" title="dbGo and Delphi">dbGo and Delphi</a></h2>

        <p>For years I believed the Professional Edition of Delphi did not provide any database access to SQL Server.  I assumed if you wanted db access you would need to import the type library for ADO included in MDAC.  But raw COM access to ADO is sometimes a pain (think BSTR and SafeArray).  So 15 minutes of googling and reading the BDS help file I discovered a gem called dbGo.  From the help file, “The dbGo components provide data access through the ADO framework.”  Go figure, or should I say “dbGo figure”?  [Geek humor, haha]</p>

<p>So my question is what advantage, if any, does the Enterprise and Architect editions of BDS provide for a SQL Server database developer?  I’m sure there are some advantages, most likely designed for the corporate developer and or enterprise environment.  But for my needs it looks like dbGo and Delphi Professional will work nicely.</p>

<p>I need to verify that I can use dbGo to access SQL Server 2005 but from what I read it looks like dbGo is nothing more than a wrapper to ADO.  And ADO can definitely talk to SQL Server.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have no problems interacting with SQL Server 2005 using dbGo and the Professional edition of Delphi.  This opens up a whole new world for me.</p>

        <p>Here’s another rant I have about SQL Server 2005.</p>

<p>Visual Studio supports a database project type.  I have used this project type for numerous projects.  It’s a great way to manage the script code for tables, stored procedures, views, and so on.</p>

<p>I first discovered the limited scripting abilities of SQL Server 2005 earlier today but I noticed the SQL Server 2005 installation process installed a copy of Visual Studio 2005 on my machine.  “Nice,” I thought.  “I’ll use it to open my database project and update my scripts from Visual Studio.”  But luck was not on my side today.</p>

<p>Even though the installation process for SQL Server 2005 installs Visual Studio, it does not install support for the database project type.  Guess I need to run the full Visual Studio installer, which seems silly to me.  After all Visual Studio supports a database project type AND a copy of Visual Studio was installed by SQL Server 2005, which is after all a database.  Seems to me it would be appropriate for the SQL Server 2005 installation to install the database project type if it is going to also install Visual Studio.  It’s definitely more appropriate than some of the things past versions of IE would install.  [Ever wonder why a web browser needs to install MDAC (Microsoft Data Access Components)?] </p>

        <p>SQL Server 2005 has been out for some time now but I have only recently made the move to it.  I’ve been in the SQL Server 2000 world because of customers but my customers are finally making the move 2005.<br /><br />Overall I really like SQL Server 2005 and the new Management Studio is nice.  However, I’m really annoyed that the SQL Server 2005 team decided to do away with the database scripting feature found in SQL Server 2000.  <br /><br />In SQL Server 2000, you can script out each database object into individual files.  I do this so I can commit the DDL source for each into CVS, or to do revision comparisons, or to do a number of other tasks.  But you cannot easily script out each object in a database with SQL Server 2005.  Apparently this is a known limitation as seen <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackid=9eb6c773-2dbb-4a27-b9d8-225d6ed4385a">here</a>.<br /><br />One option I found is to <a href="http://www.sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=23185">write a programming using .NET 2.0 and the SQL Management Object (SMO)</a>.  Unfortunately time is not a luxury I have and I have an immediate need to script out the each object in a database into individual files.  So I started down the path of script out each object individual.  <br /><br />Guess what?  It has its own set of problems.  First starters, there is not an option to generate a script that contains both the DROP and CREATE statements.  Instead what I do is generate the CREATE statement to a query window.  Next I generate the DROP statement to the clipboard followed by pasting the clipboard content to the query window.  Needless to say, this is a painful process, and I have hundreds of database objects to script out.<br /><br />I can’t believe the model used for generating scripts in previous versions of SQL Server did not make it into SQL Server 2005.  I would have expected the same functionality at a minimum, and possibly an improvement on past versions.  But I would never have guess it was removed completely.</p>

Work on <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>’s next product, WS-Workbench (also called Swirl internally) is coming along nicely as you can see from this screen shot.  The first beta should be ready soon.  Post a comment or send me an email if you are interested in beta testing WS-Workbench once it is ready.</p>

<p>A couple of big challenges still remain before the beta is ready.  For instance, reading the data types defined in XML Schema that represent the parameters for a web service call isn’t as straight forward as I originally hoped.  This is due in part to the lack of a Delphi native SOM parser.  Well, that’s not exactly true.</p>

<p>Delphi does have an undocumented <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2006/04/05/xml_schema_object_model_som_parser_for_delphi.aspx">SOM parser</a>, but it depends on a registered XML DOM parser such as MSXML.  While it does work White Peak does strive to reduce dependences on certain types of 3rd party library such as MSXML.  This means writing my own SOM.  Luckily it will be a specialized SOM parser and not one intended for general purpose.</p>

        <p>Some days I find it hard to stay focused.  There are many new technologies to play with and I want to spend time with them all.  I’m itching to install the latest version of <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a> and see what has changed in the last year.  I also want to port a web part I wrote for SharePoint from C# to <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi/">Delphi</a> and make it a DNN module.  There’s also a few Ajax frameworks I want to experiment with, and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html">GData</a> (Google Data API) is something I’m really, really anxious to play with.<br /><br />The fun doesn’t stop there.  Microsoft’s Windows Workflow Foundation and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) are peaking my interest too.  /n software isn’t helping my focus problem either by releasing a new <a href="http://www.nsoftware.com/workflow/">workflow</a> and <a href="http://www.nsoftware.com/ssis/">SSIS</a>.  Just more fun stuff to play with.<br /><br />Maybe I need a new <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> company policy allowing 8 hours per week to “technology play time”.</p>

        <p>I was hoping to make one more trip to Killington this season before packing away the snowboard, but it doesn’t look like it going to happen.  Killington announced today it will close on May 1st for the 2005-2006 season.  Looking at recent pictures I’m surprised they are able to stay open that long but Killington does have its image of staying open longer than any other East Coast resort to keep.  <br /><br />What a crappy season the East Coast had this year.  Here’s hoping there will be much more snow next season.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2006/04/27/first-visit-to-fenway/" rel="bookmark" title="First Visit to Fenway">First Visit to Fenway</a></h2>

        <p>My wife and I went to Fenway the other night to see the Redsox play.  It was our first visit to Fenway.  I like the stadium despite the small size.  As a matter of fact, I said to me wife I felt like we were at a minor league game because of the stadium size.  Plus, the stadium seems to be very family friendly with a kid throwing the first pitch and a kid making the standard “Play ball!” announcement.  The vibe and stadium size reminded me of the two minor league teams in New York.  However, that opinion changed once the game got started.  The crowd definitely fills the stadium with cheers and you definitely feel like you are at a major league game once the first pitch is thrown.<br /><br />Boston fans are definitely loyal fans.  But unlike St. Louis where just about every wears red, Boston fans have no one color.  Sure the Redsox fans are wearing some type of Redsox shirt but some shirts are blue, some are white, some are red…I even saw a green Redsox shirt.  Go figure.  One of the things I like about going to a Cardinals game in Busch stadium is seeing the sea of red.<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, I thought the ticket prices were reasonable and definitely cheaper than a Yankees game.  Granted I paid for my tickets through the normal channel and I didn’t get ripped off by some scalper selling a $40 ticket for $150.  The food is also cheaper at Fenway compared to Yankee Stadium.  The only thing that was more expensive is the beer.<br /><br />Fenway charges way too much for beer.  Yes, a beer at Yankee stadium will run you something like $8 but it is twice the size of the wimpy $6 beer at Fenway.  So by the end of the game we spent as much as we would at Yankee stadium but that was only because we had to buy more beers at Fenway than we typically do at Yankee Stadium.</p>

        <p>I upgrade my server install of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/gsx/">VMware GSX Server</a> with <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">VMware Server</a>, a free virtualization product for Windows and Linux currently in beta.  The VMware Server install went smoothly.  It detected the GSX install and uninstalled it for me.  It copied the appropriate settings over to VMware Server and my virtual machines were up and running again in a matter of minutes.  <br /><br />VMware Server is an improvement on GSX Server.  Most notable improvement is that it works with virtual machines created with VMware Workstation 5.x.  No more hacking the .vmdk file to make it work with GSX.</p>
