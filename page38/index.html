        <p>Microsoft’s Michael Howard and others have started a <a href="http://nonadmin.editme.com/">wiki</a> on Least-privileged User Account (LUA) security.  Last year I tried running under LUA but found I needed administration privilege for many things, from installing software to writing code.  Needless to say I gave up on my quest to use LUA daily.  But with more information available today such as the <a href="http://nonadmin.editme.com/">nonadmin wiki</a> I think it time for me to try again.  Besides, I want to guarantee that my software installs and runs without a problem under least-privileged user accounts.</p>

        <p>Last week I asked a few friends to send me feedback on SMTP Diagnostics.  I’ve made good progress on the program since that time and I hope to have the first release available to the public within the next few of weeks.  <br /><br />Today my focus was improving the user interface.  I was able to eliminate the tab control across the top, which I never really liked.  The new interface also has a web look to it that I think improves the overall look.  Take a look at the improvements made and let me know what you think.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticsnapshot01.JPG">Old user interface</a> versus <a href="http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticssnapshot02.gif">new user interface</a>.</p>

        <p>I’m putting the finishing touches on White Peak’s first product called SMTP Diagnostics.  The product does exactly what the name implies.  It helps diagnose problems that can occur when sending e-mail through an SMTP server.  But this last bit of work is proving to be time consuming.<br /><br />I need to setup the product web page.  I need to draft the EULA.  I need to install and setup forum software, which will be used to offer community support for SMTP Diagnostics.  I have to create the installer and publish a <a href="http://www.asp-shareware.org/pad/">PAD</a> file.  Then there’s marketing.  <br /><br />I need sign up with a reseller.  I need to include marketing techniques in the application, and I need to setup an online store where people will hopefully buy licenses.  Whew, the list goes on.  <br /><br />Good news is that once I have finished I’ll be able to reuse much of the infrastructure for new products.</p>

        <p>I’m back in New York City where the temperature is higher then in Atlanta.  It feels like it is going to be a long, hot summer in the city.  Anyway…<br /><br />My return flight gave me time to reflect on the ICCA National Conference I attended over the weekend.  I realized how important professional development in the area of business is for a computer geek like me.<br /><br />When I started my company I believed I knew enough to run a successful company.  After all, I have been in the industry for 20 years and I know software development.  I’ve been told repeatedly by my peers that I’m in the top percentage of software developers, and I feel I have some unique qualities that allow me to exceed client expectations.  <br /><br />This was the confidence I needed to get my company going.  I thought, “I know and understand software development and therefore the clients will come.”  However, I missed some very important points such as having a focus, knowing how to sell and market, and how to grow a business.<br /><br />Events, like the one this past weekend, prove to be invaluable to me.  Like many other computer geeks I spent the majority of my career learning technology while ignoring the business side of the industry, but understanding the business side is so important especially to a computer geek wishing to go independent, whether you are building a consulting practice or going to be an ISV.<br /><br />To be successful in the software industry requires more skills than slinging high quality code.  An ISV can produce the best application in the world but that application will not make a dime if it is not marketed correctly.  A consultant may know how to solve the most complex problems in a given industry but that individual will never find the right gigs without knowing how to sell his or her services or how to find and engage the right clients.<br /><br />Point is a computer geek owning a business must understand the principals of running a business and how to succeed in that business.  This is equally as important if not more important as the quality of the work produced.<br /><br />I made a conscious decision last year to study more on business related topics.  My book case, which was once full of technology books, is now packed with books covering marketing, accounting, selling, and other small business topics.  I have replaced attending technology events like TechEd and PDC with business related events like the ICCA National Conference.<br /><br />I still have much more to learn.  Heck, it took me 20 years to get where I am at with regard to software development and it will probably take me another 20 years to reach that same level of confidence in business.<br /><br />If you are considering breaking away from the traditional software development job to pursue independence, I highly recommend reading the following business books:<br /><br /><a href="http://secure.emythworldwide.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=EMREV-BK-S&amp;Category_Code=BK&amp;Store_Code=EMW">The E-Myth Revisited</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1932531297/qid=1118775433/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-6159067-2662225?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Guerrilla Marketing in 30 Days</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0066620996/qid=1118775288/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-6159067-2662225?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap…and Others Don’t</a><br /><br />And many of the books written by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&amp;field-author-exact=Alan%20%20Weiss/103-6159067-2662225">Alan Weiss</a> including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471479691/qid=1118775466/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/103-6159067-2662225?v=glance&amp;s=books">Getting Started in Consulting, Second Edition</a>.<br /><br />I also recommend joining a trade organization like <a href="http://www.icca.org/">ICCA</a> and <a href="http://www.asp-shareware.org/">ASP</a>.</p>

        <p>I’m spending the weekend in Atlanta at my first business related conference.  Conferences I have attended in the past were technology related such as the Borland Developer Conference and Microsoft PDC so I wasn’t sure what to expect.<br /><br />I definitely see a difference beyond the topics at this conference compared to the developer conferences I’ve attended in the past.  For one, attendees at a business conference tend to dress better than the t-shirt and jeans geek crowd of dev cons.  Another difference is the ease of networking.  It is very easy to approach people at the event.  I have already met a number of people, which makes the event more enjoyable.  It’s comforting feeling like you are surrounded by friends.</p>

        <p>Earlier today I joked about the lack of jeans and t-shirts at a business related conference.  But the ICCA National Conference does have something unique about it.  Although everyone here works with computers and many are programmers, the conversations and event topics center around business.  There are discussions on improving your marketing strategy, determining the price point, and tricks to grow your business.  But today’s talk on creating a strategic plan for your business really hit home with me.<br /><br />The speaker provider great information on creating a strategic plan and he provided a nice template to follow.<br /><br />Define your goals - What do you want to achieve?  What is the big picture outcome?<br /><br />For each goal, define the objectives - What are 3 to 5 major measurable accomplishments that need to happen during the planning period?<br /><br />Define the strategies - What core strategies are needed to attain the objective?<br /><br />And lastly, define the actions - What could we/should we do to deliver on the strategies?<br /><br />This got me thinking about my current goal for White Peak Software, and after some dialog with a fellow attendee I came up with the start of my strategic plan.<br /><br />Goal: <br /> Establish White Peak Software as a Micro-ISV<br /><br />Objectives: <br /> Release one new product by the end of 2005<br /> Setup e-commerce and support infrastructure<br /> Attract interest in White Peak Software<br /><br />Strategies:<br /> Product Release Strategy<br /> Marketing Strategy<br /><br />Actions:<br /> To be determined<br /><br />Obliviously I am not going to spend all day blogging my strategic plan.  After all, the conference is still going on and the next session is about to start.  My point, however, is that this conference provides a unique opportunity for computer geeks like to me to expand my mind and learn more about running a business.</p>

        <p>I purchased a pricy set of components today, or at least I tried.  The browser window timed out during the final processing of the order.  The problem is I do not know if the order went through or not.<br /><br />I sent an email to the company’s support and sales addresses but I haven’t heard anything back yet.  I find this very annoying.  At a minimum I would expect an auto-responder that sends a return email saying something like “We value you business.  We will respond to your request as soon as possible.”  It’s been 40 minutes now with no response.  Obviously the vendor does not use an auto-responder.  <br /><br />An auto-responder is a simple use of technology that I believe all companies selling products on the Internet should use.  Heck my own company, <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>, has the capability enabled to provide immediate response to client requests.  It amazes me that a successful component vendor who has been in business for years does provide the simplest of services to its customers.<br /><br />All is not lost though.  I have learned a valuable lesson from the experience.  <br /><br />1) Auto-responders can be very powerful and provide assurance to customers.  <br />2) Vendors should provide detailed information about what to expect from an online ordering experience.<br /><br />This second point is very important to me as I prepare to start selling products.  I definitely plan to publish a web page that explains the order process to customers.  This will tell my customers what to expect and what to do should something go wrong.</p>

        <p>I am preparing the first beta release of a new application that is used for diagnosing problems with SMTP.  The program allows the user to test account settings against an SMTP server by sending a test message.<br /><br />I have been testing the program from various locations including the hotel here in Atlanta.  I was surprised to see that the network here redirects SMTP requests to its own SMTP server which relays the message to the appropriate destination.  No wonder laptop users have problems with email.  The experience behind the scenes can be different based on the network and the user may never know.<br /><br /><a href="/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticsnapshot01.JPG"><img src="/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticsnapshot01.JPG" border="0" width="380" height="331" /></a><br />Click image to enlarge.</p>
