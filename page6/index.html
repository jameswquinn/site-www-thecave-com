I’m preparing to take a long distance hike in a few weeks (more details on that coming soon), so I’ve been researching different ways to reduce the amount of fuel I need for cooking. I came around this neat posting that explains <a href="http://blackwoodspress.com/blog/6582/ultralight-backpacking-pot-cozy/">how to make an backpacking pot cozy</a>. It sounds like a neat idea, and perfect for me since I plan to eat a lot of Mac-n-Cheese on the hike. So I took a stab at making my <a href="http://photos.thecave.com/Random/DYI-Pot-Cozy/24476733_NV9jrG">own pot cozy</a> for my <a href="http://www.snowpeak.com/cookware/backpacking/trek-700-titanium-scs-005t.html">Snow Peak Trek 700 titanium mug</a>. I’m happy with the end results, but I have yet to test the cozy to see how effective it is. That will be my next project later this week.</p>

We took a 3-night/4-day camping trip to Silver Lake in Vermont. We had a great time. Our camp site was on top of a hill surrounded by trees, and the lake was just a short walk down the hill. Pictures from our trip are available <a href="http://photos.thecave.com/Trips/Camping-Trips/Silver-Lake/24392143_pj99p6">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Rowan has recently been sleeping later into the mornings. This is great because Melanie and I both prefer sleeping in as well. I remember when Rowan first started sleeping through the night. He would wake up at 5:30 in the morning to start his day. I used to say, if only he would sleep until 6 am. And of course he did start sleeping until 6 am over time. When that happened, I starter saying, if only he would sleep until 6:30 am. As he slept later, I continued saying to myself, sleep until 7 am. Then it was 7:30 am. Then 8 am.</p>

<p>He is now consistently sleeping until sometime between 8 and 9 am each morning, and I’m loving it. But as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. Lucky for me that end doesn’t come for another year when the kid start kindergarten. Until that time, I’m going to enjoy the extra sleep.</p>

        <p>I returned from my second trip using the GR1, and I can now say the <a href="https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3">Goruck GR1</a> is now my favorite everyday backpack. My latest trip was to WWDC, and the GR1 kicked ass. I packed everything I needed for the week in the ruck, and I used it as my daypack each day at the conference. I especially like how slim the bag is even when stuffed full. I had no problems sliding it in and out from under the seat on the plane. And the zippers are quiet enough when opening and closing as to not disturb those sitting around me at the conference during talks.</p>

<p>Here was my packing list for the conference:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 T-shirts</li>
<li>A pair of flip-flops.</li>
<li>A paid of Five Finger shoes.</li>
<li>A rain jacket.</li>
<li>A pack towel (don't forget your towel)</li>
<li>A pair of jeans.</li>
<li>Boxes and extra socks (for the sneakers I worn to and from SF)</li>
<li>15" MacBook Pro (circa 2007, not one of those uber cool new ones)</li>
<li>Power supply and extended power cord for the MBP</li>
<li>Ethernet cable</li>
<li>iPad</li>
<li>Headphones</li>
<li>Charging cables, styluses, Square</li>
<li>Tooth brush, toothpaste, deodorant, soap</li>
<li>Beard trimmer and beard comb</li>
<li>Buttons and pins for lanyard flare</li>
<li>Extra field guide</li>
<li>A buff</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I attached a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086UBPDM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0086UBPDM">Condor H2O pouch</a> to my GR1 to carry my water bottle on the plane ride. And I put the stuff in my pockets (wallet, iPhone, field notes, pen, pocket flashlight, and Fitbit) into the pouch when going through TSA security. I love that I can expand my GR1 as needed like this using the molle webbing. I took the H2O pouch off during the week while attending the conference since my water bottle fit fine in the bag.</p>

<p>The only issue I had was returning home with extra shirts and the WWDC jacket. I didn’t have the needed space for the extra stuff, so the WWDC jacket and a couple of pairs of boxers went into a sack that I carried. Next year I’ll remember to leave room for swag on the return trip.</p>

<p>My first trip with the GR1 was to Arkansas with my son to go car camping with my dad, brother, and his son. While the GR1 performed well on this trip, it wasn’t a good test for me since I was not traveling light on that trip. Most of the gear was checked for the plane ride since it was camping gear. Still, the pack served me well on that trip.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2012/05/31/only-9-more-pounds-to-go/" rel="bookmark" title="Only 9 more pounds to go">Only 9 more pounds to go</a></h2>

        <p>I weighed myself today. I’m 11 pounds lighter than I was 7 weeks ago, and I’ve lost a little more than an inch off my waist.</p>

<p>Like most people, I have slowly gained weight over the last 10 years. But that weight gain quickly accelerated after <a href="http://rowanturner.net/">Rowan</a> was born. I don’t know how much I have gained since he was born, but I estimate it to be around 15 to 20 pounds. I was the heaviest I’ve ever been.</p>

<p>And like most people, I have wanted to loss weight. I just don’t have the time to hit the gym 5 days a week. So how did I lose 11 pounds in 7 weeks?</p>

<p>It started shortly after <a href="http://ideveloper.tv/nsconference/">NSConference</a>. Drew McCormack <a href="http://twitter.com/drewmccormack/status/185247058398154752">tweeted</a> that he was under 80kg for the first time in years. What caught my attention was the #4hourbody hash tag. I immediately thought of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307465357">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>, and I thought this hash tag might be related. Turns out, it is. The author of The 4-Hour Workweek wrote another book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=030746363X">The 4-Hour Body</a>.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed The 4-Hour Workweek, I thought the The 4-Hour Body would be nonsense. Still, I added to my wish list as something to read later.</p>

<p>That time came a few weeks later. I wanted something different to read, and thinking about my ever increasing weight I decided to buy The 4-Hour Body. I read through the first part of the book that talks about rapid fat loss. It recommends a diet that is very much inline with what I like to eat. Meat and beans. Lots of meat and beans. </p>

<p>After reading this part of the book, I decided to give it a try. I was already eating chicken and pork daily, but I was also eating ice cream and cereal every day. And my side dishes with my chicken and pork were usually rice or potatoes.  I cut out the daily ice cream, and I replaced the cereal with a fried egg. And I replaced my side dishes with beans. </p>

<p>I used to eat lots of beans, but my wife can’t stand them. So for years, I would only have beans a couple of times a week. Now I have them a couple of times a day.</p>

<p>In addition to the slight change to my daily diet, I decided to hire a personal trainer. For the longest time, I’ve wanted to get back into a route of go to the gym, but my busy life has made it hard to do. I knew hiring a trainer would motivate me to go, and so far it has worked. I’ve been going to the gym 1 hour a week since I started this personal challenge.</p>

<p>So that’s what I changed. I cut out daily ice cream, cereal, rice, and potatoes. I added an egg a day, lots of beans, and 1 hour per week at the gym. And as a result, I have lost 11 pounds in 7 weeks. Not the rapid results the book claims can be achieved, but I’m only loosely following the book’s advice. In fact, I haven’t even finished reading the book. I read what foods to eat and not eat then ran with it.</p>

<p>I also kept it a secret that I was on this mission to lose weight. Even my wife didn’t know for weeks that I was loosely following a diet (though she was noticing the results). That’s how minor of a change I made with my diet.</p>

<p>The trick for me now is to continue with the weight lost. I want to lose a total of 20 pounds, returning to my ideal weight of 150 pounds. I have only 9 pounds to go (woohoo!). The real fun, however, begins after I hit my goal - keeping the weight off.</p>

        <p><img src="/images/blog/2012-05-30-goruck.jpg" alt="IMG 6146" border="0" width="180" height="270" class="alignleft" />
My <a href="https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3">Goruck GR1 backpack</a> arrived today, and so far I’m very impressed with it. The construction of this bag is top notch, and the bag screams quality. I love the minimalistic look and it’s low profile. It is a little stiff coming right out of the box, but it’s already loosening up after packing and unpacking it a few times and wearing it around the house.</p>

<p>I did a test run packing the GR1, loading it with the clothes (jeans, t-shirts, boxers, socks, rain jacket) and gear (iPad, MacBook Pro 15”, cables, Bose headphones) I plan to take to San Francisco in a couple of weeks. The GR1 had plenty of space for my stuff with room to spare. The true test, of course, comes this weekend when I take it on a camping trip with Rowan.</p>

<p>I have high hopes for this bag. It will be my go to bag for most things I do, from being my main laptop bag to being the bag I take on short trips (7 days or less - I pack light). There is, however, one change I would make to the GR1.</p>

<p>The front, outside pocket is deep enough to hold my iPad, which makes it great especially for air travel. However, the pocket could be about a half inch deeper. There’s room on the bag to make this happen. </p>

<p>Other than this one change, the bag appears to suit my needs perfectly, and I’m very excited to put it to the test this summer.</p>

<p>Side note: Read <a href="http://www.gorucknews.com/gear-explained/gr1-explained-by-jason-goruck%E2%80%99s-founder/">GR1 Explained</a> for details on the features of this wonderful bag.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure I would <a href="http://uncrate.com/stuff/the-cave-tent/">buy this tent</a>, but I do like the name. An inflatable tent does sound interesting, but at 11.5 pounds plus a hand pump, I’m not sure it’s for me. Then again, my current “big” tent does take 5 to 10 minutes to setup and teardown.</p>

        <p>I’m in the final stagings of writing my book, and to help out, the wife gave me the okay to spend a few days in Vermont along. No wife. No kid. Just me and my laptop.</p>

<p>The trip to Vermont has, so far, been great. It’s given me the time I need to make some real progress on the completing the book. It’s also given me time to do things I don’t normal get to do anymore.</p>

<p>Acknowledgement: Yes, I know what follows will likely anger the wife, but hey, I’m just trying to <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/2c8c4b3b58/chappelle-show-when-keeping-it-real-goes-wrong-1">keep it real</a>.</p>

<p>Things I’ve done this weekend that I normally don’t do:
- Write code for hours on end…uninterrupted.
- Work the book…uninterrupted.
- Go to sleep when I want, but more importantly wake up when I want.
- Have hours of peace and quiet. No talking. No socializing with others.
- And best of all, take a shower each day.</p>

<p>The combination of sleep and alone time is just want I needed. And the daily showers, icing on the cake.</p>

<p>Thanks Melanie and Rowan for giving me this time.</p>

<p>Update: I do miss having reliable high-speed Internet access.</p>

        <p>Hey! What’s going on here? A new blog post after more than a year and a half?</p>

<p>Yes, that’s right. I’m slowing getting back into the swing of things, and one of those things is updating thecave.com with my pointless, boring, thoughts.</p>

<p>A lot has happened since that last post in December 2009. My company, <a href="http://whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>, has changed directions and is now focused entirely on iOS and Mac OS X development. Rowan has gotten older.  And I’m nearing the end of writing my <a href="http://learnipadprogramming.com/">first book</a>.</p>

<p>Time will tell if I’m truly back into the swing of things, but I’m hopeful I will have more time to post personal rants. Welcome back…to me.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2011/08/15/salem-the-bike-city/" rel="bookmark" title="Salem The Bike City">Salem The Bike City</a></h2>

        <p>Salem Mass is often known as The Witch City, but it’s also trying hard to become a bike city. One example of this comes from today’s announcement about a <a href="http://www.salemnews.com/local/x850300025/Salem-to-join-major-cities-in-offering-bike-sharing-program">free bike sharing program</a> here in Salem. The city has also made improvements to off-road bike paths and recently completed the striping of on-street bike lanes. The problem, however, I have with biking in Salem is with the North Shore drivers.</p>

<p>I’ve lived and biked in four different cities (and surrounding metro areas): Memphis, St. Louis, New York, and Salem. And of the four I find Salem to be the least bike friendly. The problem isn’t the city and its attention to bicycling as an alternative form of transportation. The problem is with the annoying, and often times, clueless North Shore drivers in Salem. </p>

<p>Many of these drivers ignore the most basic of driving rules. Left hand turns from the right lane. Right hand turns from the left lane. Pulling out into cross traffic to stop traffic. And stopping the flow of traffic to let an oncoming car turn left. These are but a small example of the poor driving I witness almost daily in and around Salem.</p>

<p>When my wife and I moved to Salem, we thought the Boston area had the worse drivers around. As it turns out, the problem drivers seem to be restricted to the North Shore area only. Family and friends who come to visit are oftentimes shocked at what a North Shore driver will do.</p>

<p>So the randomness of poor driving by North Shore drivers makes Salem a bike unfriendly city. But it doesn’t stop there. Some of the drivers who don’t drive like complete idiots think the sidewalk is the place for bicycles. I’ve been yelled at many times from drivers to “get off the road” and “use the sidewalk”. </p>

<p>One particular time I was stuck in traffic on Essex Street. A clueless driver driving a van kept stopping. The driver was apparently lost. The street was narrow because of cars parked on the side, so I had to claim my place in the line of traffic. Now mind you, I was riding with traffic. In other words, I was keeping up with traffic and not slowing anyone down. We were only moving about 10 miles per hour, and that’s when we were moving. Oftentimes we were stopped. The van was making the traffic stop and go. As I said, the driver was lost or even possibly talking on the phone (another rant for another time).</p>

<p>A car squeezes up to me, and the woman driver, apparently nervous to have a bicyclist in front of her, started yelling at me. I told her she should be yelling at the driver of the van ahead of us because it was him causing the traffic problem. And I said it was perfectly legal for me to ride my bike in the lane as long as I obey traffic laws, which I was (and better than she was - she would pull into the oncoming lane just to yell at me). Of course, this woman had to make it her duty to continue harassing me every time the van stopped traffic. I finally had enough of the yelling woman and the crazy van driver, so I rode past the line of traffic and darted down a side street. </p>

<p>This is just one example of the many problems I’ve had with motorist in the witch city.</p>

<p>I hope Salem continues to promote bicycling in and around the city. I, for one, would like to see this city become more bike-friendly. But I think one part missing from Salem’s bike strategy is education. Area drivers need to be better educated about the rules of the road.</p>
