        <h2><a href="/2006/01/16/using-dunit-with-finalbuilder/" rel="bookmark" title="Using DUnit with FinalBuilder">Using DUnit with FinalBuilder</a></h2>

        <p>After installing FinalBuilder for the first time, I looked through the list of actions to see what 3rd party tools were supported.  I was pleasantly surprised to see an action for every tool I use in software development except one, DUnit.  I thought this was odd but I soon realized that DUnit is supported, just not as a custom action.<br /><br />Follow these steps to use DUnit in FinalBuilder:<br /><br />1) Add a Compile Delphi Win32 Project action to your FinalBuilder project.<br />2) Point the Compile Delphi action to your DUnit project and configure it as needed to compile the project.<br />3) Add an Execute Program action to the FinalBuilder project.  This action is found under the Windows OS action group.<br />4) Point the action to the compiled bits from the Compile Delphi action.  In other words, point it to your DUnit program.<br />5) Mark the Log Output option, which should be marked by default.<br /><br />That’s it.  FinalBuilder will run your DUnit unit tests as part of the build process and the output from the tests will be captured by FinalBuilder.  And of course you can configure the FinalBuilder project to act accordingly based on the pass/fail result of your unit tests.<br /><br />Some people might think FinalBuilder should have a custom action for DUnit.  However, the action would only be a direct copy of the Execute Program action.  Or maybe it would combine the Compile Delphi and Execute Program actions into a single action.  But as you can see a custom action is not needed.  DUnit unit tests are support through the Execute Program action and a custom action specific to DUnit would just be a waste of time for the folks at Vsoft Technologies.  Their time is better spent adding support for more tools and adding more features to an already great product,<br />FinalBuilder.</p>

        <p>I spent the day migrating various Visual Studio projects to Borland Developer Studio 2006.  For the most part the projects easily moved over but I did have some problems with one project group.  <br /><br />This project group contains multiple C# library projects and an ASP.NET C# web application.  The BDS converter for the project group did not set the parent reference for some of the .aspx and .ascx files.  However, I was able to quickly fix this using a text editor.<br /><br />One Visual Studio feature I do miss since moving to Borland Developer Studio is Copy Web Project.  I really like this feature to xcopy an ASP.NET web application to a new directory that contains only the files needed for runtime.  The Professional Edition of BDS does not have this feature.  However, I was able to quickly clone this feature using FinalBuilder.<br /><br />Right now I’m very happy with the move to Borland Developer Studio.  Using one IDE for all my development work (Delphi, C# and ASP.NET 1.1) is making me a more productive software developer.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2006/01/13/smtp-diagnostics-review/" rel="bookmark" title="SMTP Diagnostics Review">SMTP Diagnostics Review</a></h2>

        <p><a href="http://email.about.com/mbiopage.htm">Heinz Tschabitscher</a> posted <a href="http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/gr/smtp_diagnostic.htm">a review about SMTP Diagnostics</a> on About Email.  I have to say I agree with Heinz when he says “SMTP Diagnostics does not help you understand or fix errors.”  It is true <a href="http://www.smtpdiagnostics.com/">SMTP Diagnostics will help you understand what is happening assuming you understand the protocol message</a>, but the tool would be more useful if it explained things in plain English, which I believe is Heinz’s point.</p>

<p>It’s been on my feature list for a while now to change this.  SMTP Diagnostics should provide more help and understanding in plain English.  The challenge has been to correctly interpret the error message.  For example, I recently was troubleshooting an email problem for a web application.  In my tests using SMTP Diagnostics I enabled SMTP Authentication and provided the correct credentials for the mail server.  For the From and To I used the same email address.  The sender was checked and determined to be okay but the recipient check failed with “550 no such user here”, and I knew for a fact that the email address was valid.</p>

<p>To SMTP Diagnostics the problem is clear.  The recipient address is invalid, or at least that is what it is told by the mail server.  However, the address is very much valid and the problem is actually caused by a check on the outgoing mail server that does not allow a message to be sent from an address to the same address where the domain name in the email address is different than the domain name for the outgoing mail server.  In other words, using this particular mail server you cannot send an email to validaddress@domain.com from validaddress@domain.com from a mail server at the domain anotherdomain.com.</p>

<p>The reason for the setting is clear.  The setting is used to help prevent spam mail.  However, it is impossible for SMTP Diagnostics to properly interpret this error into plain English that accurately describes the problem.</p>

<p>Another test on the same mail server further illustrates why it is hard to correctly interpret the actual error.  The same error message, “550 no such user here” is received for a valid recipient address when the From address used is not a valid maildrop but of the same domain as the outgoing mail server.  In other words, the mail server for anotherdomain.com will report “550 no such user here” for the recipient validaddress@domain.com when the From address no-reply@anotherdomain.com is used and no-reply is not a valid maildrop.</p>

<p>These are two very different scenarios where the mail server reports the same error message, and both result from server settings used to prevent sending spam.</p>

<p>Personally I’m glad mail servers are incorporating settings that help prevent spam mail from being sent.  But at the same time it makes it more difficult to determine the actual cause of the problem when sending outgoing emails.  Still, I plan to take the feedback from Heinz’s review and improve on SMTP Diagnostics for the next release.</p>

        <p>For years I have relied on custom built build processes for software I develop.  For instance, on a recent large-scale .NET solution I used a combination of NTScheduler, VMware Workstation, CVS, NAnt, and the .NET SDK (along with other tools) to build an automated build environment.  However, doing something similar for every one of my software projects is time consuming, and I have to rely on different tools for different projects.  For example NAnt is useless for a Delphi Win32 project.  So I finally decided to give FinalBuilder a try.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.finalbuilder.com/">FinalBuilder is the ultimate tool for constructing a build process</a>.  Within minutes I was able to automate a build process for a box inventory program I am working on.  Of course projects with a more complex build process will take more than a few minutes to setup, but you should be able to automate a build process in minutes and not hours or days for most projects.  <br /><br />I’m amazed at the flexibility provided by FinalBuilder.  It supports a wide array of compilers and tools.  And it has an easy-to-use GUI for construction of the build process for every time of project I’m working on.<br /><br />I decided to see how long it would take to setup a build process for <a href="http://www.smtpdiagnostics.com/">SMTP Diagnostics</a>.  Although SMTP Diagnostics is a simple product, its build process involves a number of steps.  It is the perfect product to evaluate FinalBuilder with.  <br /><br />Here are the steps in the build process that I wanted to automate through FinalBuilder:<br /><br />- Create a build directory sandbox<br />- Retrieve the latest source code from <a href="http://www.cvsnt.org">CVS</a><br />- Compile the GUI program (using <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> 2006 compiler)<br />- Compile <a href="http://www.eurekalog.com/">EurekaLog</a> into the GUI program<br />- Compile to console program (using <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> 2006 compiler)<br />- Compile the licensing framework into the GUI and console programs (using <a href="http://www.siliconrealms.com/software.shtml">Armadillo</a>)<br />- Generate the help file system (using <a href="http://www.ec-software.com/hmpage.htm">Help&amp;Manual;</a>)<br />- Generate the installer (using <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>)<br />- Generate a zip file containing the generated installer<br />- Update and commit build number changes to CVS<br />- Tag release in CVS<br /><br />In less than 30 minutes I was able to setup the SMTP Diagnostics build process in FinalBuilder.  I can now make a complete build of SMTP Diagnostics in under a minute with a click of a button.  <br /><br />My next step in exploring FinalBuilder will be to generate the online help as HTML files and upon successful build of the product push the HTML files and the installer out to SMTP Diagnostics web site.  Given the time I spent playing with FinalBuilder, I’m confident I will be able to automate these steps as well.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2006/01/06/my-dead-or-alive-4-review/" rel="bookmark" title="My Dead Or Alive 4 Review">My Dead Or Alive 4 Review</a></h2>

        <p>For Christmas Melanie gave me a copy of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/d/deadoralive4/">Dead Or Alive 4</a> for the Xbox 360.  The game wasn’t released until the end of the December so I had to wait.  But it finally came in this week and last night I got a chance to play it.<br /><br />My review can be summed up in 4 simple words: My thumb is sore!<br /><br />I must have played 8 hours or so last night.  And yes my thumb is sore.  The game is awesome.  Story Mode can be frustrating at times but I was able to finish it in one night.  The frustration is not a bad thing although it seems like it when you are playing.  The AI in this game is incredible, which made Story Mode challenging and frustrating at the same time.<br /><br />Like other Xbox 360 games DOA4 supports leaderboards.  You can, for example, compare your best Survival Mode score against other players world wide.  My current ranking is around 10,500 out of 25,000 players.  I definitely need to work on improving that ranking.  <br /><br />As I have mentioned before, Xbox Live really makes Xbox 360 a great console.  Having the ability to compare my ranking and achievement to other players causes me to play more, and in turn leaves me wanting to buy more games.  Xbox Live is really the shining star of the Xbox 360 for the moment.  But this review is about DOA4, not Xbox Live.<br /><br />DOA4 comes with online play as well.  I played “Versus” challenges for a bit last night online.  Unfortunately I didn’t do as well as I had hoped.  There are some top notch players out there.  Online play was fun but the game play was a bit choppy.  I couldn’t tell if the performance problem was caused by my DSL line or if the problem was coming from the DOA4/Live servers.  I need to check the forums to see if other DOA4 players are experiencing the same choppiness.  I have not noticed any performance problems with other Xbox Live enabled games so I have to believe it is not my DSL line.<br /><br />Another feature I like about DOA4 is Sparring Mode.  There is a feature within this mode called Exercise, which is a great way to learn all the button combinations for a given character.  I will definitely spend more time in this mode to learn more of the advance moves and combinations.<br /><br />Overall, DOA4 is great.  The graphics are amazing.  The game play is fun.  The leaderboards are addicting.  And online play is a blast.  <br /><br />Thanks Melanie for getting me this great game.</p>
