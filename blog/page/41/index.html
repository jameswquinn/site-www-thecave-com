        <h2><a href="/2004/11/23/halo2-stats/" rel="bookmark" title="Halo2 Stats">Halo2 Stats</a></h2>

        <p>As you can probably tell from the lack of postings to this blog, I have been busy over the last month. White Peak has new clients, which is where I have been spending most of my time. But I decided to take a break over the weekend and play Halo2. <br /> <br />Halo2 is awesome! The story line is captivating, the graphics are amazing, and game play is fun. Best of all, Halo2 is Xbox Live compatible. I started playing online last night with some friends. After our frag fest party I decided to continue playing in the rank matches. As expected, every player online is better than me. But what I really like about the online experience is what happens after you finish a game. <br /> <br />Bungie.net is tracking all the statistics from the online play, and players can view their stats as well as the stats of others through the Bungie.net web site. But it doesn&#8217;t stop there. Bungie.net also provides an RSS feed for individual player stats. <br /> <br />Beginning the geek that I am, I decided to add a new web part to my <a href='http://www.thecave.com/'>blog site</a> that shows my Halo2 stats. You can view a summary in the side bar and view complete details from the <a href='http://www.thecave.com/halo2.aspx'>halo2</a> page. <br /> <br />Now that break time is over, it&#8217;s time to get back to real work.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2004/10/26/exciting-prospects-follis-style/" rel="bookmark" title="Exciting Prospects Follis Style">Exciting Prospects Follis Style</a></h2>

        <p>John Follis, President and Creative Director for <a href='http://www.follisinc.com/'>Follis, Inc</a>, spoke at tonight&#8217;s <a href='http://www.iccanyc.org/'>ICCA NYC</a> meeting about getting prospects excited. I really enjoyed his talk and he answered many questions I had. For instance, how does marketing differ from networking? <br /> <br />The difference between networking and marketing has long been a blur to me. I often wondered when one stops and the other begins. As John puts it, networking is one on one while market reaches more than one person. I am networking when I meet a new person who might be a prospect or a referral to a prospect. On the other hand, a monthly newsletter is marketing as it will reach out to more than one person at a time. Having articles published is another form of marketing as it reaches a greater audience than networking alone. <br /> <br />Another concept John mentioned tonight that I liked is how people perceive the difference between investment and expense as it relates to marketing. When marketing is done right the cost is an investment while marketing gone wrong is an expense. Here&#8217;s hoping I will continue to invest in my marketing strategy and avoid having a huge marketing expense. <br /> <br />Lastly, John pointed out that marketing is not just about giving out information. Giving out information can be stale and boring. Marketing should tap emotions. For White Peak Software this means illustrating the experience and excitement felt as the result of a successful software release. I plan to incorporate the concepts shared by John at tonight&#8217;s meeting. And as with last month&#8217;s ICCA meeting, the presentation provided real value to small IT business owners like me.</p>

        <p>Nik Kalyani of the DotNetNuke core team will be speaking at the next NYPC VB SIG on Wednesday, October 6. I&#8217;ve heard Nik will be talking about the internals of the portal software and how to write your own extensions. You should plan to attend if you have an interest in DotNetNuke. I know I will be there. The event starts at 6:15 PM at the Microsoft Office, 1290 6th Avenue, one block north of Radio City Music Hall.</p>

        <p>Some of you may have noticed that the site was down today. An unfortunate set of events prevented me from getting the site up sooner. It all started this morning when I deployed a new version of the site software. <br /> <br />I tested the changes on a Windows 2003 Server running .NET Framework v1.1. However, the production environment is running .NET Framework v1.1 Service Pack 1. Core pieces of the web site framework code that have been running problem free for years failed under Service Pack 1. I fixed the code after trouble shooting the problems, but then came more problems. <br /> <br />A series of network problems prevented me from deploying the fixes. From an issue with my wireless access point to service provider issues, it seemed as if there was something that did not want me to deploy the fixes. And to top it off, while talking with a prospect I asked that he visit the White Peak web site forgetting that the site was down. Definitely not the image I want when talking with someone about building web applications. <br /> <br />After a long day, the site is finally up and running. The code is a bit better as a result, and I&#8217;m reminded of the importance of testing software in an environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible even for a site as simple as this one.</p>

        <p>I had the pleasure of meeting <a href='http://www.wintellect.com/about/instructors/instructorbios.aspx?id=3'>Jeffrey Richter</a> of Wintellect today during his full day talk on .NET Framework internals. He talked on topics such as threading, asynchronous programming model, app domain, reflection, and key differences between C# and VB.NET. His presentation style was entertaining, and I was amazed at his depth of knowledge around the .NET Framework. I definitely learned more than a thing or two from Jeffrey. <br /> <br />I ended my day with the monthly <a href='http://www.iccanyc.org/'>ICCA</a> meeting featuring <a href='http://www.consultadhoc.com/'>Liz Lynch</a> as tonight&#8217;s speaker. Liz is a business management consultant and the author of <a href='http://www.consultadhoc.com/booklet.html'>102 Secrets to Smarter Networking</a>. She presented her approach for smarter networking, which is based on concepts of preparing, connecting, and strengthening. Her advice was invaluable and will help me improve my networking skills. <br /> <br />It&#8217;s been a great day of learning. However, I&#8217;m exhausted and ready for bed.</p>
