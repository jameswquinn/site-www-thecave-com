        <p>I should have watched that weather yesterday. There were snow flurries in New York but I didn&#8217;t think about further north. Killington got 4 inches, Stratton 3 to 4 inches, and Stowe got 6 to 8 inches. Today would have been a good day to call in sick.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2003/03/31/happy-birthday/" rel="bookmark" title="Happy Birthday">Happy Birthday</a></h2>

        <p>It&#8217;s been <a href='http://www.thecave.com/?xml/2002_03_01_archive.xml'>a year</a> since I changed thecave.com to a weblog, and it&#8217;s been interesting to watch how it has evolved from what I thought would be more technical related posting to more personal postings. I guess it&#8217;s a direct reflection of what is going on in my life. My job has been anything but technical over the last six months or so, which may explain the lack of tech postings. On the other hand, the personal postings have been well received by my friends and family who check the site on a regular basis. <br /> <br />When I first setup this weblog last year, it was basically static HTML with some ASP. Today, it&#8217;s a full blown ASP.NET application using C# with an XML backend. It also exposes Web services such as the one for the <a href='http://www.thecave.com/ws/snowreport.wsdl'>daily snow dumps</a>. The site has given me the opportunity to not only keep in touch with friends and family, but it has given me the opportunity to do something I rarely do at work. And that is to write code; something I really enjoy doing. <br /> <br />I&#8217;m curious to see what will happen over the next 12 months and how I will evolve the software for the site. For example, I have two other sites, <a href='http://www.melanieandkirby.com/'>melanieandkirby.com</a> and <a href='http://www.wastedboarding.com/'>wastedboarding.com</a>, which are based on the same software. This work is giving me ideas for creating a framework for certain types of web applications. Who knows. Maybe it&#8217;s time to port geeklogs.com to ASP.NET. <br /> <br />Thank you to all who have visited this site over the last years. And special thanks to those continue to return on a regular basis. Your encouragement gives me motivation to do more.</p>

        <p>Melanie and I just returned from a great weekend in Killington. The snow was perfect, soft and fun. Spring time conditions. I had some of my best runs of the season over the weekend. <br /> <br />We&#8217;re back in NYC for only a short time. Melanie flies out to Nice today and I have decided to join her. I need to see how she works on these international flights. I can&#8217;t wait to start pushing the call button just to get her attention. We&#8217;re back in NYC on Thursday.</p>

        <p>The possible answer to my Xbox problems. I found a How-To that explains step by step <a href='http://users.skynet.be/bk231905/tutorials/pdf/Xbox-Thompson-DVD-drive-laser-adjustment-procedure.pdf'>how to adjust</a> the laser with a Thompson DVD drive, which is the drive I have in my XBox. Interesting note, there are three different <a href='http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=23&amp;t=17216&amp;s=3ede7a8f2ebae3291651ee4e2cd10a85'>DVD drives</a> that can come with an Xbox, Phillips, Thompson, and Samsung. From what I have read, Thompson is the worse drive to have and the Samsung drive is the best. If tweaking the laser does not work then I will look at replacing the DVD drive itself.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2003/03/14/flying-home/" rel="bookmark" title="Flying Home">Flying Home</a></h2>

        <p>After 5 days in 5 cities, I am finally flying home. The week has been fun albeit tiring with days running 14 to 16 hours. Admittedly, even with the long days this was one of those weeks that left me thinking &#8220;I like my job.&#8221; Granted, I would not want to do this every week. <br /> <br />Speaking at the councils definitely improved my public speaking skills and gave me increased confidence along with an ego boost. If giving the opportunity, I would definitely do it again. <br /> <br /><a href='http://www.thecave.com/gallery/20030314-MS%20Architect%20Council/IMG_0844.JPG'><img height='90' align='left' border='0' src='http://www.thecave.com/gallery/20030314-MS%20Architect%20Council/IMG_0844.JPG' width='120' /></a>There were many highlights from the week. One of which was <a href='http://orlando.diningguide.net/data/d101871.htm'>Vito's Chop House</a> in Orlando. The steaks were amazing and mine was perfectly cooked to my preference, which is hard given that I prefer blue or black blue as they call it at Vito&#8217;s. The <a href='http://www.hardrock.com/locations/hotels/orlando/'>Hard Rock Hotel</a> in Orlando was also a highlight and is a very cool hotel. Sadly we did not get to stay the night though. Guess Melanie and I will have to make a weekend trip to Orlando soon. I know where we will be eating and staying. And the Renaissance Hotel in Boca was great and offered excellent wireless access to the Internet for free. However, I do not recommend the restaurant Porter&#8217;s, which is attached to the hotel. <br /> <br />My favorite comment from the week happened when Tom asked the group &#8220;What is a &#8216;dirty read&#8217;?&#8221; I whispered Hustler and Sluts with Big Thingies. When asked &#8220;And what is bad about dirty reads?&#8221; Ian whispered &#8220;Sticky pages.&#8221; LOL. Oh too funny. Guess you have to be a geek to get it.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2003/03/12/microsoft-architect-council-5-city-tour/" rel="bookmark" title="Microsoft Architect Council 5 City Tour">Microsoft Architect Council 5 City Tour</a></h2>

        <p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I will say it again, I enjoy working with the folks from Microsoft. I am one of three speakers at the Microsoft Architect Council in the Gulf States. My talk is on Interop with Web Services, and I&#8217;m having a good time interacting with the audience.</p>

<p>For me, the week started at 4 am on Monday. I flew down to Birmingham, AL, to meet up with the rest of the group, Ian, Tom, and Dan. BTW, Ian is a pretty cool guy and his <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/073561721X/qid=1047523174/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-5489268-5846305?v=glance&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;n=507846'>book</a> &#8220;Designing Enterprise Applications with Microsoft Visual Basic .NET&#8221; a must read for those developing enterprise applications using .NET. So the first Council was in Birmingham, which went well. The group was interactive with the speakers and everyone seemed to get a lot out of the talks.</p>

<p>Day two was another &#8220;start at 4 am&#8221; day. Bags packed, we flew to Jacksonville, FL. Yep, my return to good ol&#8217; Jacksonhell. When I started the tour, I left NYC where temperatures where around 20 degrees. Jacksonville felt like the start of summer with the temp at 81 degrees. Strangely I missed the chilly -10 of Killington. Anyway, the council was attended by a much smaller group, around 6 people, but the sessions were good. The group seemed to have similar concerns and the interactions between the group and speakers led to some very interesting conversations.</p>

<p>We got to sleep in on day three, waking up at 6 am. Trust me, that two hours makes a difference. We headed further south to Boca Raton, FL, where it definitely feels like summer time. Of course, all I can think about is the wintery mix weather in Vermont and the start of the <a href='http://www.usopen-snowboarding.com/'>US Open</a> in Stratton, which started yesterday. We had a large group joining us for the council and the talks were right on. After three days, I feel I got the story down and I feel comfortable sharing it with others.</p>

<p>The team actually gets to sleep in tomorrow, waking up at 6 am again. We head to Tampa where I had hoped to see Darren and Jeff. But that&#8217;s not going to happen because we have to head to Orlando once we are done in Tampa. Most of our nights end around 10 pm, but I&#8217;m guessing tomorrow will end around midnight. But hey, what&#8217;s 18 hours between friends.</p>

<p>So Orlando will be my last day before returning to New York. I&#8217;m really enjoying this tour and the Microsoft guys are great. But I also have to add that I miss Melanie, who is doing her own thing in Paris this week.</p>

I don&#8217;t know why this city rubs me wrong. It just does. Wednesday I will be in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa on Thursday, Orlando on Friday, returning to the city Friday night. Should be a fun week.</p>
