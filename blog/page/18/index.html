        <h2><a href="/2006/08/12/last-2-weeks/" rel="bookmark" title="Last 2 Weeks">Last 2 Weeks</a></h2>

        <p>I&#8217;ve been away for the last two weeks, which means I have a back log of emails waiting for responses. Since it will be a few days before I can answer all of the emails I thought I sled light on what has happened over the last two weeks and the events that caused me to go dark.<br /><br /><b>Rip VanWinkle</b><br /><br /><img src='http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/theripvanwinkles.jpg' width='324' border='0' height='243' align='right' alt='VanWinkle Family' /><br />First, my cousin Michael, aka Rip, aka Mike, died unexpectedly on Sunday, June 30. Michael and I grew up together and he was like a brother to me. I haven&#8217;t seen Michael as much as I would have liked over the last few years because I live in the Northeast and he was in Jackson, Tennessee. I only saw him, and his awesome wife and daughters once or twice a year. But I still think of him often and exchange the occasional email, phone call and text messages from time to time throughout the year.<br /><br />It&#8217;s been almost two weeks since I got the phone call about Michael and there is still a part of me that is in disbelief. I believe this is due in part to the fact that we only saw each other a couple of times a year. But I know it is going to hit me, as it already had a few times, when I don&#8217;t receive any more picture emails Rip&#8217;s cute daughters, or I don&#8217;t hear his laugh at the next Redneck Shindig. <br /><br />I love you and miss you. Farwell buddy. <br /><br /><b>Time Away</b><br /><br />After receiving the news about Michael, my wife Melanie and I headed down to Memphis to be with the family. It was a very emotional week, which left Melanie and me both thinking a lot about death. We had a vacation planned for the week of the unfortunate event so we postponed it by one week. This gave Melanie and me time to talk to each other about Michael, death, funerals, family, and so on. But we also enjoyed some time being disconnected from the world.<br /><br />We went to <a href='http://www.nps.gov/acad/'>Acadia National Park</a> on Mount Desert Island in Maine. We stayed at the <a href='http://www.bassharbor.com/'>Bass Harbor campgrounds</a>, which is a great place to stay by the way. We rode bikes through the carriage roads of Acadia, drove up to the summit of Cadillac Mountain, dipped our toes in the frigid ocean waters, took a swim in Echo Lake, ate lobster, and saw amazing sceneries. It was the perfect getaway.<br /><br />On the drive back home from Acadia we decided to surprise the Davis clan by making a quick visit to Killington, Vermont. Melanie&#8217;s whole family was there. Seeing them was a great way to end the events of the last two weeks.<br /><br />We&#8217;re back in Salem now, which means a return to reality of emails, work travel and more new security changes at airport ports. May be it&#8217;s time for the whole world to take a vacation, disconnect, and get a fresh to outlook on things.</p>

And there is a Delphi favor of SQLite called <a href='http://www.zeitungsjunge.de/delphi/sqlite3/'>DISQLite3</a>.  I recently used DISLite3 to help merge data from different files and I found it easy to use and very fast.</li><br /><li>I did a little mountain biking in <a href='http://www.salemwoods.org/'>Salem Woods</a>.  I didn't have time to ride the whole loop but I did enjoy what little I did ride on.  Tight single track and lots of rocks and roots.</li><br /><li>My vacation officially starts when Melanie gets home from work.  Unfortunately Boston is being hit hard with a summer time thunderstorm so her flight has been delayed.  Still the start of vacation time is just hours away.</li><br /><li>After working in Visual Studio 2003 for a few days this week, I had to switch back to <a href='http://www.borland/delphi'>Borland Developer Studio 2006</a>.  It has definitely become my favorite IDE even for C# projects.  But what if I am working with a team?  I wonder how confusing it might be if I continued using BDS while other teammates user Visual Studio.  Guess I'll have to try it and see.<br /></li></ul>

        <p>Kevin Downs, of <a href='http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/'>NDoc</a> fame, has decided to <a href='http://johnsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/07/ndoc-20-is-dead.html'>stop work on NDoc</a>. One reason is the lack of love from the .NET community. This widely used open source tool for generating source code documentation from .NET applications has received very few community contributions and from what I gathered even less financial support. And to make matter worse Kevin was the victim of a mail-bomb attack believed to be directed at him for not providing .NET 2.0 support fast enough.<br /><br />I&#8217;m not surprised at the lack of community support but the mail-bomb attack is just plan insane. I don&#8217;t blame Kevin for stepping down.</p>

        <p>In this recent article on eWeek, Tod Nielsen said <a href='http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1993731,00.asp?kc=EWEAUEMNL072506EOAD'>Borland is close to naming the buyer for DevCo</a>. He also said the process should be complete by the end of September. Exciting time indeed for software developers. <br /><br />Many people thing Delphi is dead, but they are dead wrong. I&#8217;ve been hearing the same time for 10 years now from people who have never even tried Delphi. &#8220;Delphi is dead.&#8221; &#8220;There is no future for Delphi.&#8221; And so on. Not only is this wrong, but the future of Delphi is brighter than ever.<br /><br />I jumped onto the .NET C# bandwagon in the early days. My first C# work started right after the Summer 2000 PDC, and I worked with C# exclusively from 2001 through most of 2004. <br /><br />Soon after starting <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com'>White Peak Software</a> I realized I needed a &#8220;secret weapon&#8221; not only for custom software development work but for the products White Peak Software plans to publish. That secret weapon is <a href='http://www.borland.com/delphi'>Delphi</a>. I have been able to do so much more for our customers, in less time and at a lower cost beacuse Delphi.<br /><br />Corporations and uppper management will never get it. Microsoft development tools are a safe choice, and in many cases .NET within the enterprise makes the most sense. But for those developers who need a tool that allows them to do many things, Delphi or rather Borland Developer Studio is perfect. The ability to write native Win32 application and .NET applications from the same IDE is priceless.</p>

        <p>The last few weeks have been very busy for me so I haven&#8217;t had time to post as many blog entries as I would like. SO here&#8217;s a quick list of random thoughts I have had recently.<br /><br /><ul><br /><li><a href='http://www.winternals.com/Company/PressRelease92.aspx'>Microsoft acquires SysInternals and WinInternals</a>.  Big news in my opinion.  I'm curious to see what Microsoft will do with the excellent SysInternal tools like Process Explorer.</li><br /><li>Speaking of SysInternals, Mark Russinovich has an interested <a href='http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/04/coming-net-world-im-scared.html'>take on .NET managed application</a>.  I agree with him that client only applications shouldn't be managed applications.</li><br /><li><a href='http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php'>Foxit Reader</a> is awesome.  It is a PDF reader but unlike Adobe's PDF reader Foxit loads fast and doesn't require an install.  The single Foxit exe has made its way into my bin directory of useful tools.</li><br /><li>Allen Bauer points out that <a href='http://blogs.borland.com/abauer/archive/2006/07/19/26094.aspx'>Foxit has an SDK</a> that allows you to embed a PDF reader into your application.  And best of all it supports <a href='http://www.borland.com/delphi/'>Delphi</a>.</li><br /><li><a href='http://www.babyotis.com/index.php?/archives/201-Silence.html'>Four grand to remove a tree</a>?

Most noticeable was the lack of built-in support for unit test projects and creating unit test cases.  BDS simplifies the setup of unit tests.</li><br /></ul></p>

        <h2><a href="/2006/07/13/essex-county-tops-most-overpriced-list/" rel="bookmark" title="Essex County Tops Most Overpriced List">Essex County Tops Most Overpriced List</a></h2>

        <p>I lived in the West Village, Manhattan for just over 6 years. Earlier this year my wife and I moved to Salem, Massachusetts. We have a number of reasons for moving such as a change in life style, wanting to be closer to the mountains of New England, etc. Cost is definitely one of the reasons. We were spending more and more time outside of NYC making it hard to justify paying high rent for an apartment we didn&#8217;t see much, especially in the winter time. <br /><br />I was surprise to learn that Essex County, Massachusetts, which is where Salem is located, is ranked at the top of the recent <a href='http://realestate.msn.com/Rentals/Articleforbes.aspx?cp-documentid=648559&amp;GT1=8384'>Forbes most overprice places in the United States</a>. (New York is ranked number 6.) Granted we don&#8217;t live in one of the <a href='http://rmne-remaxadvantagerealestate-salem-ma.com/Properties/PropDispForm.php?idx_prop=101582664&amp;QueryID=44b53c2373630&amp;3'>awesomely big water front homes</a> mentioned in the article. I wish we did. But homes at a million and more is beyond what we can afford. I will say, though, that $1.4 million for a 4,000 square foot water front home does seem like a better deal to me than a $1.4 million, 2 bedroom, 900 square foot condo in downtown Manhattan.</p>
