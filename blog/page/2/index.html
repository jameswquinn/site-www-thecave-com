        <h2><a href="/2012/05/31/only-9-more-pounds-to-go/" rel="bookmark" title="Only 9 more pounds to go">Only 9 more pounds to go</a></h2>

        <p>I weighed myself today. I&#8217;m 11 pounds lighter than I was 7 weeks ago, and I&#8217;ve lost a little more than an inch off my waist.</p>

<p>Like most people, I have slowly gained weight over the last 10 years. But that weight gain quickly accelerated after <a href='http://rowanturner.net/'>Rowan</a> was born. I don&#8217;t know how much I have gained since he was born, but I estimate it to be around 15 to 20 pounds. I was the heaviest I&#8217;ve ever been.</p>

<p>And like most people, I have wanted to loss weight. I just don&#8217;t have the time to hit the gym 5 days a week. So how did I lose 11 pounds in 7 weeks?</p>

<p>It started shortly after <a href='http://ideveloper.tv/nsconference/'>NSConference</a>. Drew McCormack <a href='http://twitter.com/drewmccormack/status/185247058398154752'>tweeted</a> that he was under 80kg for the first time in years. What caught my attention was the #4hourbody hash tag. I immediately thought of the book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307465357'>The 4-Hour Workweek</a>, and I thought this hash tag might be related. Turns out, it is. The author of The 4-Hour Workweek wrote another book called <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=030746363X'>The 4-Hour Body</a>.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed The 4-Hour Workweek, I thought the The 4-Hour Body would be nonsense. Still, I added to my wish list as something to read later.</p>

<p>That time came a few weeks later. I wanted something different to read, and thinking about my ever increasing weight I decided to buy The 4-Hour Body. I read through the first part of the book that talks about rapid fat loss. It recommends a diet that is very much inline with what I like to eat. Meat and beans. Lots of meat and beans.</p>

<p>After reading this part of the book, I decided to give it a try. I was already eating chicken and pork daily, but I was also eating ice cream and cereal every day. And my side dishes with my chicken and pork were usually rice or potatoes. I cut out the daily ice cream, and I replaced the cereal with a fried egg. And I replaced my side dishes with beans.</p>

<p>I used to eat lots of beans, but my wife can&#8217;t stand them. So for years, I would only have beans a couple of times a week. Now I have them a couple of times a day.</p>

<p>In addition to the slight change to my daily diet, I decided to hire a personal trainer. For the longest time, I&#8217;ve wanted to get back into a route of go to the gym, but my busy life has made it hard to do. I knew hiring a trainer would motivate me to go, and so far it has worked. I&#8217;ve been going to the gym 1 hour a week since I started this personal challenge.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s what I changed. I cut out daily ice cream, cereal, rice, and potatoes. I added an egg a day, lots of beans, and 1 hour per week at the gym. And as a result, I have lost 11 pounds in 7 weeks. Not the rapid results the book claims can be achieved, but I&#8217;m only loosely following the book&#8217;s advice. In fact, I haven&#8217;t even finished reading the book. I read what foods to eat and not eat then ran with it.</p>

<p>I also kept it a secret that I was on this mission to lose weight. Even my wife didn&#8217;t know for weeks that I was loosely following a diet (though she was noticing the results). That&#8217;s how minor of a change I made with my diet.</p>

<p>The trick for me now is to continue with the weight lost. I want to lose a total of 20 pounds, returning to my ideal weight of 150 pounds. I have only 9 pounds to go (woohoo!). The real fun, however, begins after I hit my goal - keeping the weight off.</p>

        <img src='/images/blog/2012-05-30-goruck.jpg' alt='IMG 6146' border='0' height='270' width='180' class='alignleft' />
<p>My <a href='https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3'>Goruck GR1 backpack</a> arrived today, and so far I&#8217;m very impressed with it. The construction of this bag is top notch, and the bag screams quality. I love the minimalistic look and it&#8217;s low profile. It is a little stiff coming right out of the box, but it&#8217;s already loosening up after packing and unpacking it a few times and wearing it around the house.</p>

<p>I did a test run packing the GR1, loading it with the clothes (jeans, t-shirts, boxers, socks, rain jacket) and gear (iPad, MacBook Pro 15&#8221;, cables, Bose headphones) I plan to take to San Francisco in a couple of weeks. The GR1 had plenty of space for my stuff with room to spare. The true test, of course, comes this weekend when I take it on a camping trip with Rowan.</p>

<p>I have high hopes for this bag. It will be my go to bag for most things I do, from being my main laptop bag to being the bag I take on short trips (7 days or less - I pack light). There is, however, one change I would make to the GR1.</p>

<p>The front, outside pocket is deep enough to hold my iPad, which makes it great especially for air travel. However, the pocket could be about a half inch deeper. There&#8217;s room on the bag to make this happen.</p>

<p>Other than this one change, the bag appears to suit my needs perfectly, and I&#8217;m very excited to put it to the test this summer.</p>

<p>Side note: Read <a href='http://www.gorucknews.com/gear-explained/gr1-explained-by-jason-goruck%E2%80%99s-founder/'>GR1 Explained</a> for details on the features of this wonderful bag.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;m not sure I would <a href='http://uncrate.com/stuff/the-cave-tent/'>buy this tent</a>, but I do like the name. An inflatable tent does sound interesting, but at 11.5 pounds plus a hand pump, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s for me. Then again, my current &#8220;big&#8221; tent does take 5 to 10 minutes to setup and teardown.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;m in the final stagings of writing my book, and to help out, the wife gave me the okay to spend a few days in Vermont along. No wife. No kid. Just me and my laptop.</p>

<p>The trip to Vermont has, so far, been great. It&#8217;s given me the time I need to make some real progress on the completing the book. It&#8217;s also given me time to do things I don&#8217;t normal get to do anymore.</p>

<p>(Acknowledgement: Yes, I know what follows will likely anger the wife, but hey, I&#8217;m just trying to <a href='http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/2c8c4b3b58/chappelle-show-when-keeping-it-real-goes-wrong-1'>keep it real</a>.)</p>

<p>Things I&#8217;ve done this weekend that I normally don&#8217;t do: <ul>
<li>Write code for hours on end...uninterrupted.</li>
<li>Work the book...uninterrupted.</li>
<li>Go to sleep when I want, but more importantly wake up when I want.</li>
<li>Have hours of peace and quiet. No talking. No socializing with others.</li>
<li>And best of all, take a shower each day.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The combination of sleep and alone time is just want I needed. And the daily showers, icing on the cake.</p>

<p>Thanks Melanie and Rowan for giving me this time.</p>

<p>Update: I do miss having reliable high-speed Internet access.</p>

        <p>Hey! What&#8217;s going on here? A new blog post after more than a year and a half?</p>

<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m slowing getting back into the swing of things, and one of those things is updating thecave.com with my pointless, boring, thoughts.</p>

<p>A lot has happened since that last post in December 2009. My company, <a href='http://whitepeaksoftware.com/'>White Peak Software</a>, has changed directions and is now focused entirely on iOS and Mac OS X development. Rowan has gotten older. And I&#8217;m nearing the end of writing my <a href='http://learnipadprogramming.com/'>first book</a>.</p>

<p>Time will tell if I&#8217;m truly back into the swing of things, but I&#8217;m hopeful I will have more time to post personal rants. Welcome back…to me.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2011/08/15/salem-the-bike-city/" rel="bookmark" title="Salem The Bike City">Salem The Bike City</a></h2>

        <p>Salem Mass is often known as The Witch City, but it&#8217;s also trying hard to become a bike city. One example of this comes from today&#8217;s announcement about a <a href='http://www.salemnews.com/local/x850300025/Salem-to-join-major-cities-in-offering-bike-sharing-program'>free bike sharing program</a> here in Salem. The city has also made improvements to off-road bike paths and recently completed the striping of on-street bike lanes. The problem, however, I have with biking in Salem is with the North Shore drivers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve lived and biked in four different cities (and surrounding metro areas): Memphis, St. Louis, New York, and Salem. And of the four I find Salem to be the least bike friendly. The problem isn&#8217;t the city and its attention to bicycling as an alternative form of transportation. The problem is with the annoying, and often times, clueless North Shore drivers in Salem.</p>

<p>Many of these drivers ignore the most basic of driving rules. Left hand turns from the right lane. Right hand turns from the left lane. Pulling out into cross traffic to stop traffic. And stopping the flow of traffic to let an oncoming car turn left. These are but a small example of the poor driving I witness almost daily in and around Salem.</p>

<p>When my wife and I moved to Salem, we thought the Boston area had the worse drivers around. As it turns out, the problem drivers seem to be restricted to the North Shore area only. Family and friends who come to visit are oftentimes shocked at what a North Shore driver will do.</p>

<p>So the randomness of poor driving by North Shore drivers makes Salem a bike unfriendly city. But it doesn&#8217;t stop there. Some of the drivers who don&#8217;t drive like complete idiots think the sidewalk is the place for bicycles. I&#8217;ve been yelled at many times from drivers to &#8220;get off the road&#8221; and &#8220;use the sidewalk&#8221;.</p>

<p>One particular time I was stuck in traffic on Essex Street. A clueless driver driving a van kept stopping. The driver was apparently lost. The street was narrow because of cars parked on the side, so I had to claim my place in the line of traffic. Now mind you, I was riding with traffic. In other words, I was keeping up with traffic and not slowing anyone down. We were only moving about 10 miles per hour, and that&#8217;s when we were moving. Oftentimes we were stopped. The van was making the traffic stop and go. As I said, the driver was lost or even possibly talking on the phone (another rant for another time).</p>

<p>A car squeezes up to me, and the woman driver, apparently nervous to have a bicyclist in front of her, started yelling at me. I told her she should be yelling at the driver of the van ahead of us because it was him causing the traffic problem. And I said it was perfectly legal for me to ride my bike in the lane as long as I obey traffic laws, which I was (and better than she was - she would pull into the oncoming lane just to yell at me). Of course, this woman had to make it her duty to continue harassing me every time the van stopped traffic. I finally had enough of the yelling woman and the crazy van driver, so I rode past the line of traffic and darted down a side street.</p>

<p>This is just one example of the many problems I&#8217;ve had with motorist in the witch city.</p>

<p>I hope Salem continues to promote bicycling in and around the city. I, for one, would like to see this city become more bike-friendly. But I think one part missing from Salem&#8217;s bike strategy is education. Area drivers need to be better educated about the rules of the road.</p>

        <p>I received an email today telling me a company is attempting to use my company name to register a .asia domain name. My first call to action was to check with my preferred domain name registrar to see if the .asia name was actually available, which it is.

        <p>We have the <a href='http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/evolve'>Griffin Evolve</a> sound system for the iPod, which I use from time to time to listen to music from my iPod touch. Unfortunately the sound system was within reach of <a href='http://www.rowanturner.net/'>Rowan</a> who decided yesterday to pull back and forth on the docked iPod touch. This unfortunately bent the connector pins in the iPod touch connector port. And now whenever the iPod touch is docked the music starts and stops, plays out only 1 speaker, and or sometimes it makes an awful noise. <br /><br />Okay, so I can&#8217;t use the iPod touch with the Griffin system by docking it. That&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll just connect it using the headphone jack. Problem solved, or so I thought.<br /><br />Today I discovered the iPod touch shorting out when connected to my laptop. It didn&#8217;t occur to me yesterday I would have this problem but an electrical short is an electrical short. And no matter what I try the device keeps disconnecting and reconnecting every minute or so when plugged into the laptop.<br /><br />I&#8217;m debating whether I should try getting the device fixed or just buy another one. If I get another one I can let the kid have the broken one. It could be fun to see how long it takes before he completely destroys it. <br /><br />Regardless of what I decide to do, I did learn my lesson and now the sound system is out of the kid&#8217;s reach.</p>
