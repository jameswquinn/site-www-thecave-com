        <p>Melanie and I ended our ski/snowboard season this weekend in Killington, VT. The spring time conditions were great. Mash potato bumps, slush, and firm snowpack could be found throughout. Saturday was mostly cloudy to very cloudy while Sunday was nothing but blue bird skies.<br /><br />We didn&#8217;t get in as many days as we have in past seasons but that was expected given the wedding and all. Still this season gave us the best snow conditions either of us have seen while we were in Whistler. This season also gave us our first visit to Park City, UT, where we got to visit with Kate and Shawn. We got some hang time with Brooke and Josh on a Killington weekend trip. I completed my snowboard/Lord of the Rings birthday trilogy. And we got to spend time on the slopes of Killington with the whole Davis crew.<br /><br />Even though it was a short season for us, it was still a great one. And it has left me wanting more. I can&#8217;t wait until next season.<br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>The fact the yesterday was St Patty&#8217;s Day totally escaped me. I didn&#8217;t even have a beer yesterday. And I can&#8217;t recall missing a St Patty&#8217;s Day celebration since 1994. What has my job done to me that I missed one of my favorite holidays of the year?

        <p>Interesting panel discussion on the real costs of going offshore. <br /> <br /><a href='http://zdnet.com.com/1601-2-5171489.html'>ZDNet News</a>: &#8220;&#8216;Offshoring&#8217; is the term du jour, but the process it describes is complicated and riddled with pitfalls. At the Sand Hill Group&#8217;s Software 2004 conference in San Francisco, a panel of senior executives share their experiences and warn that the total costs of ownership can be higher than expected.&#8221;</p>

        <h2><a href="/2004/03/09/southwest-airlines/" rel="bookmark" title="Southwest Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a></h2>

        <p>I wonder if A&#38;E; new show <a href='http://www.aetv.com/tv/shows/airline/'>Airline</a> is helping or hurting business for <a href='http://www.southwest.com/'>Southwest Airlines</a>. It seems every episode I have seen shows a paying passenger being refused boarding because he or she has had a few drinks prior to boarding. In tonight&#8217;s episode a 72 year old man was denied boarding by Southwest because he had a little too much to drink at the airport bar while waiting for a 3 hour delayed flight. Because it was the last flight of the night the old man had no choice but to either sleep in the airport or find a hotel.<br /><br />I for one typically visit the airport bar when my flight is delay by hours. And I have been known to be a little tipsy by boarding time, but once I am on the plane I sleep through the flight. However I can&#8217;t help but wonder if I would have been denied boarding if I had been flying Southwest Airlines. <br /><br />And what of these individuals denied boarding a Southwest flight for throwing back a few frosty brews as they wait for their flight? Do they pose a threat to the other passengers? Does Southwest believe these individuals will cause a disruption on the plane? <br /><br />In one episode a gospel singing group took a Southwest flight. On the flight the group sang songs. These individuals were sober. However in my opinion the sober singing group seemed more disruptive then the beer drinking individuals who denied boarding.<br /><br />There&#8217;s probably more to the story then what is aired on the TV show. However it seems that Southwest has a strict policy against drinking prior to flying, which makes me glad I don&#8217;t fly Southwest.<br /><br /><br /></p>
