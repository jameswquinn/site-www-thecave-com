        <p>I have been talking about Vertigo for a couple of years now. Vertigo is a software product line currently under development at White Peak Software. In a nutshell it is an email program for the Windows desktop. And yes, it will be release this year.<br /><br />Why develop yet another email program? Simple, none of the available mail programs suit my needs as a small business owner. And I have tried them all including Outlook, The Bat, Eudora, Poca, and ThunderBird. My needs are not unique and there is definitely an untouched market out there, which is why we are building yet another, albeit, a new kind of email program.<br /><br />We current have a working version of Vertigo that is being used daily. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one&apos;s_own_dog_food'>Dogfooding</a> an email program, though, can have its challenges especially given than I must send emails out every day. The thing that has surprised me the most is the large amount of crap contained in mail messages.<br /><br />We are building a database containing thousands and thousands (soon to be hundreds of thousands) of real mail messages. Of course the majority of the messages in our database are spam mail. This will be extremely helpful when work begins on the spam filter feature. But the spam messages are also proving to be helpful in uncovering bugs in Vertigo. Malformed message headers, date formats, and MIME encoding are common. Then of course there are the attachments containing questionable content. It&#8217;s been amazing to see what actually happens with email under the hood.</p>

        <p>It&#8217;s been over a month since my last blog posting. I&#8217;ve been very busy the last 2 months and haven&#8217;t had time to make any thoughtful postings. Today&#8217;s no different.<br /><br />For those who don&#8217;t know me well I travel a lot. Not as much as I did a few years ago but enough. I have definitely scaled back on the travel in recent years, but I&#8217;m still out of town at least twice a month on average. So I thought I might be fun to track the places I visit in 2007.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll update this page after each trip. That way I will know if I travel as much as I think a do.<br /><ol><br /><li>Jan 14 - Jan 15: <a href='http://www.killington.com/'>Killington</a> VT</li><br /><li>Jan 17 - Jan 20: <a href='http://www.killington.com/'>Killington</a> VT</li><br /><li>Jan 22 - Jan 25: <a href='http://www.brussels.org/'>Brussels</a> and <a href='http://www.brugge.be/'>Brugge</a></li><br /><li>Feb 1 - Feb 5: <a href='http://www.sugarloaf.com/'>Sugarloaf</a> Maine</li><br /><li>Feb 11 - Feb 12: <a href='http://www.killington.com/'>Killington</a> VT</li><br /><li>Feb 14 - Feb 15: <a href='http://www.killington.com/'>Killington</a> VT</li><br /><li>Feb 27 - Feb 28: Salt Lake City UT</li><br /><li>Feb 28 - Mar 6: <a href='http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/'>Whistler BC</a></li><br /><li>Mar 9 - Mar 10: New York City (great party Joe)</li><br /><li>Mar 17 - Mar 18: New York City (St Patty's Day celebration)</li><br /><li>Mar 21 - Mar 23: <a href='http://www.killington.com/'>Killington</a> VT</li><br /><li>Mar 30 - Apr 3: <a href='http://www.killington.com/'>Killington</a> VT</li><br /><li>Apr 10 - Apr 13: <a href='http://www.killington.com/'>Killington</a> VT (Thursday was an epic day.)</li><br /><li>May 1: <a href='http://www.killington.com/'>Killington</a> VT</li><br /><li>May 4 - May 7: Bryn Athyns PA</li><br /><li>May 25 - May 27: <a href='http://www.east-durham.org/'>East Durham</a> NY</li><br /><li>June 1 - June 4: <a href='http://www.arkansasstateparks.com/villagecreek/'>Village Creek State Park (AR)</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Branch,_Mississippi'>Olive Branch MS</a></li><br /><li>June 15 - June 17: Conway Lake NH</li><br /><li>June 29 - July 1: Loudon NH (NASCAR weekend)</li><br /><li>July 11 - July 12: New York City</li><br /><li>July 17 - July 18: New York City</li><br /><li>July 18 - July 20: <a href='http://www.bermudatourism.com/'>Bermuda</a> (business)</li><br /><li>July 31 - August 12: <a href='http://www.capemay.com/'>Cape May</a>, <a href='http://www.nps.gov/asis/'>Assateague Island</a>, and <a href='http://www.outerbanks.org/'>The Outer Banks</a></li><br /><li>August 20 - August 21: Phoenix AZ</li><br /><li>August 31 - September 1: New York City</li><br /><li>September 4 - September 7: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>September 10 - September 13: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>September 17 - September 21: Bermuda (business)</li><br /><li>September 21 - September 23: St. Louis (Lovefest 07)</li><br /><li>September 24 - September 27: Bermuda (business)</li><br /><li>September 29 - September 30: Baltimore</li><br /><li>October 1 - October 2: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>October 5 - October 7: Lake George, NY</li><br /><li>October 8 - October 11: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>October 17 - October 20: Killington VT</li><br /><li>October 23 - October 26: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>October 28 - October 30: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>November 5 - November 7: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>November 9 - November 11: Booneville MS</li><br /><li>November 12 - November 15: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>November 19 - November 20: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>November 21 - November 25: Killington VT</li><br /><li>November 26 - November 29: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>December 11 - December 14: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>December 20 - December 23: Killington VT</li><br /><li>December 23 - December 27: Bryn Athyn PA</li><br /></ol></p>

        <p>4 years ago my best friend Dave was fighting cancer. He had a rare form of leukemia called granulocytic sarcoma. <br /><br />4 years Dave was fighting for his life. There were times we didn&#8217;t think he would live. I remember talking with Dave&#8217;s dad in December (4 years ago). He said to me &#8220;We thought we lost him last night.&#8221; That conversation really sticks in my head, and it was one of the worse nights for Dave during his 9 month hospital stay.<br /><br />4 years ago Dave struggled to walk. Just walking to the bathroom across the hospital room was a major challenge for Dave, many times requiring assistances. <br /><br />4 years later (today) Dave faces a different kind of challenge. Today Dave runs in the <a href='http://www.runcharlotte.com/'>Charlotte Thunder Road Marathon</a>. The guy who 4 years ago could barely walk and was fighting for his life is running a marathon. Dave&#8217;s cancer has been in remission and he&#8217;s healthy again. Dave is the most amazing person I know. <br /><br />Dave, have fun in today&#8217;s run!<br /><br />Read about Dave&#8217;s struggle with cancer and his turn around in this <a href='http://www.charlotte.com/mld/observer/living/health/16165911.htm'>Charlotte Observer article</a>.<br /><br />Update: <a href='http://onlineraceresults.com/race/view_individual.php?make_printable=1&amp;bib_num=369&amp;race_id=4560&amp;type=result'>Dave's final time: 4:42:55</a><br /><br /><img src='http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/dave-and-kevin-20061209.JPG' /></p>

        <p>WTF&#8230;<a href='http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/12/how_not_to_distribute_security_1.html'>Apple distributed a QuickTime security patch through MySpace</a>. This is crazy!<br /><br />First of all, I&#8217;m not a fan of QuickTime for various reasons. I stopped using it years ago and I no longer have it installed. But when I read <a href='http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/12/how_not_to_distribute_security_1.html'>this blog posting</a> about Apple distributing a security patch through MySpace it made me glad not to be a QuickTime user. And to think Apple has been running ads on TV about the Mac being more secure than the PC. Will the day come when Mac users need a MySpace account to install the latest Mac OS security patch?<br /><br />What the heck was Apple thinking?</p>

        <h2><a href="/2006/11/29/interview-with-bjarne-stroustrup/" rel="bookmark" title="Interview with Bjarne Stroustrup">Interview with Bjarne Stroustrup</a></h2>

        <p>TechnologyReview.com has a very good <a href='http://www.technologyreview.com/InfoTech/17831/page1/'>interview with Bjarne Stroustrup</a>, the creator of C++. In the interview Bjarne talks about what is wrong with software development. One quote that really stuck a cord with me is:<br /><br /><div class='quote'><br />"Looking at "average" pieces of code can make me cry. The structure is appalling, and the programmers clearly didn't think deeply about correctness, algorithms, data structures, or maintainability. Most people don't actually read code; they just see Internet Explorer or Windows "freeze," have their cell phone drop a call, read the latest newspaper story about viruses, and they shudder."<br /></div><br /><br />So true, so true. <br /><br />Many programmers today are only worried about getting a feature out the door as quickly as possible ignoring the fundamentals of software development. This is typically driven by demands from management. I for one have been guilty of taking shortcuts just to meet unrealistic demands. This is one of the reasons I left the corporate IT world. I was losing pride in my work and I felt I was starting to forget the fundamentals of software development.<br /><br />Bjarne also says (towards the end of the interview):<br /><br /><div class='quote'><br />"A lot of thinking about software development is focused on the group, the team, the company. This is often done to the point where the individual is completely submerged in corporate "culture" with no outlet for unique talents and skills. Corporate practices can be directly hostile to individuals with exceptional skills and initiative in technical matters. I consider such management of technical people cruel and wasteful."<br /></div><br /><br />I am by no means the best programmer nor do I consider myself an expert, but this is something I have definitely experienced first hand on more than one occasion and with more than one employer. In a way it was good for me (I worked with good companies) because I got to do a lot of R&#38;D; work inventing new things, which was a lot of fun, that never went into production but aided in completing production systems. I have been called everything from a maverick to a hero to a lose cannon. And all because I insisted on being myself, an individual with a passion for software development. It wasn&#8217;t that I was against the team or company. I just wanted our software to be the best it could be. I wanted time to think about proper algorithms and data structures, and most importantly maintainability. I knew as I do today that the right amount of up front time can have huge payoffs in the long run. Unfortunately too many in the software industry think only of the next 6 months and not of the next 6 years.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2006/11/22/explosion-in-danvers-ma/" rel="bookmark" title="Explosion in Danvers MA">Explosion in Danvers MA</a></h2>

        <p>Early this morning, around 2:45 AM, my wife and I were woken up by a thunderous boom that shook the house. We both jumped out of bed, looked out the window, but all was quiet. I thought maybe the explosion was downstairs in the basement so I went down to check it out. My wife turned on the TV and tuned in to local Boston news channels but there was nothing about an explosion. No breaking news. Nothing. Finally I went outside to see if I could tell what happened. Still not luck.<br /><br />We were up for almost an hour worried that something bad had happened. It was hard to go back to sleep. For us, being from New York City, it was strange how quiet the streets were. It seems the explosion did not wake any of our neighbors. And there was nothing on the local news. As a matter of fact the local news was nothing more than a re-broadcast of an early news broadcast. Boy, we miss <a href='http://www.ny1.com/'>NY1</a> at times like this.<br /><br />Well, the mystery of what happened was uncovered this morning when I checked <a href='http://www.boston.com/'>Boston.com</a>. Seems there was a <a href='http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/11/explosion_rocks.html'>major chemical explosion in near by Danvers</a>. <br /><br />We live a few miles from Danvers and we felt the affects of the explosion, so it must have been one heck of an explosion. As I said it woke up from our sleep and shook the house. And we live a few miles away. It&#8217;s amazing no one was seriously hurt.</p>
