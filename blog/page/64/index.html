        <p>Melanie and I decided to enjoy the snow from today&#8217;s blizzard with a walk through Central Park. The park was full of people enjoying the weather; from snowboarders riding the short hills to cross country skiers out for a bit of exercise to kids riding sleds, we saw it all. Hopefully I will get some pictures posted very soon.</p>

        <p>After two weeks of no new snow in Whistler, I return home just in time for a big dump in New York City. Looks like over a foot of snow so far and it&#8217;s still coming down. I love it but I wish this had happened in Whistler. And I wish I had a car because I would definitely be heading up to Catkills to snowboard.</p>

        <p>Over the last two weeks, I have been replicating my blog posting to thecave.com and wastedboarding.com. WASTED II is now over so I will return to only posting to appropriate site, which will be primarily this site cocked full with my rumblings. And I will start the rumble with a comment about my iPod. <br /> <br />The iPod kicks! I love this puppy. All day travel yesterday was made much more enjoyable with my iPod in pocket. Random play on 10 gigs of music for over 10 hours and still plenty of battery life left. It&#8217;s the only way to travel.</p>

<p>WASTED II is over and the snow has finally returned to Whistler. 10 inches of the new stuff in the last 24 hours. Just our luck. Hopefully those who decided to stay over the weekend got to ride some of the new snow. As for me, I am ready to ride the Northeast again, which is having a <a href='http://www.transworldsnowboarding.com/snow/news/article/0,13009,423155,00.html'>great season</a> albeit a very cold one.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone would joined us this year, Melanie, Joe, Therese, Justin and his crew, Karen and Charlie, Katie, Ray, Brooke and Josh, Jeff, Tom, Kate and Shawn, and lastly Dave Dot. And who knows, there just might be a WASTED III next year.</p>

<p>See you on the slopes.</p>

<p>The final days in Whistler brought no new snow but still lots of good times. We rode parts of the mountain that none of us had every seen before. Places like Whistler Bowl, Doom and Gloom, and others. The bumps were big, the snow was hard, and the views were spectacular. Ray took a bad fall in the park and was the only WASTED guest to visit the emergency room this year. And Melanie, in a very rare moment, decided to see if she could knock down a tree. Unfortunately for her the tree won.</p>

<p>Things have really been hopin&#8217; in the Village and I haven&#8217;t taken the time to update the web site. So here is a brief recap from the last few days.</p>

<p>First, there are no pictures for Day 10. Sorry but some bozo (named KT) forgot to bring the CF card. Pictures for Day 9, 11 and 12 are finally online.</p>

<p>Kirby and Joe took a snowboard lesson on Monday, which consisted of pipe, park, and speed. Yep, but have finally been introduced to the fun of park and half pipe. Dave would be so proud.</p>

<p>Jeff had a fun experience on the slopes. He lost a ski in Whistler Bowl and had to hike to retrieve it. It would have been very funny to see but he was out on the slopes by himself that day.</p>

<p>Brooke and Josh has an incredible first day on Whistler. Josh had a grin ear to ear all day. We covered a lot of terrain and all of us at exhausted.</p>

<p>And finally, the Murphy&#8217;s have arrived. Shawn is already trying to start the drinking games. Imagine that.</p>

<p>Until next time&#8230;</p>

<p>Still no new snow but the apres&#8217; ski is happening. We stopped by Merlin&#8217;s for a huge order of chicken nachos and more beer. Beer, beer, beer&#8230;it&#8217;s the only thing still fresh on the mountain. This beer talk is making me thirsty.</p>

<p>Another day on Whistler. Another day without new snow. The high pressure system causing the dry, sunny days is expected to stay in place at least through Tuesday. So we decided to make it a short day and had lunch at the Longhorn. Little did we know people, specifically those from the National Brotherhood of Ski, would be at the Longhorn early to reserve tables for the evening party time. By 3 o&#8217;clock the line to get in was out the door but we had our table. The bids for our table were numerous and becoming interesting&#8230;like the woman who offered to buy us two rounds for rights to the table we left. But we had already promised the table to another group. Oh well. It was still a fun, unique experience at the Longhorn.</p>

        <h2 id='day_6_return_to_blackcomb'>Day 6: Return to Blackcomb:</h2>

<p>Today was the return to Blackcomb. The snow was much better than the other day especially in the afternoon. Blackcomb Glacier was very nice and the views were incredible. 7th Heaven was the place to be this afternoon. The snow was soft from the warm temps and sun. But we are too exhausted to take advantage of the conditions with multiple runs.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing else new to report. Sunny, warm weather and still no new snow. Jonesboro, Arkansas has got more new snow this week than Whistler. And the forecast calls for more of the same sunny weather through at least Monday.</p>
