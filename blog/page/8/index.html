<p>I can honestly say I have bitten off more than I can chew when it comes to prepping the new house for our move in. I have developed a new hatred for wallpaper. Pulling down wallpaper and prepping the walls for priming is a very time consuming process. But with luck I should be ready to start priming walls by Thursday.</p>

        <p>2007 is winding down and I return home later today from my final trip of the year. I started a <a href='http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/01/26/my_trips_in_2007.aspx'>travel log</a> this year to see how much I actually travel. 46 trips in total for 2007. Too much in my opinion. I hope to see a lot less travel in 2008.<br /><br />The travel log idea is cool, and I plan to do another for 2008 even though I&#8217;m hoping for fewer trips. I wish I had travel logs for past years. I think the biggest difference I would see for past years compared to 2007 is the diversity of trips. Vermont and New York City were my most common trips in 2007. In past years, I traveled more with Melanie on flights she worked and got to spend more time in places such as France. I made only 1 work trip with her in 2007, to Belgium, and I missed out on trips to France and Ireland this year which really disappoints me.<br /><br />Even though I hope to travel less in 2008, I&#8217;m hoping to join Melanie on more work trips (as soon as she returns to work). And the best part of work trips in 2008 with Melanie will be bringing <a href='http://www.melanieandkirby.com/babyt/'>Baby T</a> with us.</p>

        <p>Some might be wondering why I didn&#8217;t post a blog entry announcement that I&#8217;m a father-to-be. After all such big news rightfully deserves a posting. Truth be told, I didn&#8217;t want to share the news publicly until after the closing on the new house for fear that the mortgage company might find out and decide not to provide us the loan for the house. I&#8217;m sure I was being a bit paranoid but given the current state of the leading market I did not want to chance it.<br /><br />I did, however, post a slight hint on July 23. The posting title is &#8221;<a href='http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/07/23/excited_about_expected_new_arrival.aspx'>Excited About Expected New Arrive</a>&#8221; and while the posting talks about arrival of my new MacBook Pro, I was actually more excited about finding out I&#8217;m going to be a dad. July 23 is the day I found out.</p>

<p>It should be illegal to sell a house with wallpaper. And the punishment should double for those who wallpaper the ceiling too.</p>

<p>The wife and I are working like eager beavers to get the <a href='http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/3997880/1/232528797'>house</a> ready for a January move in date. And while January is still a couple of weeks away we only a have few more work days left this month for house work due to the holiday. And the task that is slowing us down the most? You guessed it. Wallpaper!</p>

        <h2><a href="/2007/12/18/long-time-no-post-2/" rel="bookmark" title="Long Time No Post">Long Time No Post</a></h2>

        <p>I know. I know. It&#8217;s been a very long time since my last blog posting. I have never gone this long between posting since starting this blog back in March 2002. The longest delay between postings until now was back when I made the move from NYC to Salem. The delay was almost 2 months, but this most recent delay has been just over 4 months. Way too long to go without a posting, especially considering all that has happened in the last 4 months. Needless to say, though, with all that has happened over the last 4 months my schedule has been unusually busy which is why I haven&#8217;t had time to post. Staying in hotels without Internet access hasn&#8217;t helped either.<br /><br />So the 2 biggest events that have happened are:<br /><br />1) My wife and I are expecting a baby boy at the end of March!!!! I can&#8217;t begin to tell you how excited I am about this. Already it seems like I discovery something new about being a daddy-to-be on an almost daily basis. For instance, just the other day I could see the baby moving around in my wife&#8217;s belly. I heard this was possible and I thought it would be freaky, like watching Aliens or something. But it turned out to be really cool. And the movements seems to be more frequent and more visible each day. I&#8217;ll be posting more about being a daddy-to-be / new dad. Meanwhile, check out our <a href='http://www.melanieandkirby.com/babyt/'>baby blog</a>.<br /><br />2) We bought a house! Yep, after living most of my life in rental property and all of my adult life in rentals, I can finally say I&#8217;m a home owner. I still don&#8217;t think owning a home is a wise financial investment, but I can say I love the idea behind owning a home. There&#8217;s nothing quiet like it. The freedom to do what you want such as paint, remodel, etc, to make the place your own is awesome.<br /><br />And on the business front, White Peak Software continues to grow. Yes, I know I have fallen behind on release the next Killink CSV and SMTP Diagnostics updates and for that I apologize. But it has been very important to me to put certain &#8220;ducks in a row&#8221; so I can focus on time on these products in 2008.<br /><br />So that&#8217;s it for now.</p>

        <p>Since <a href='http://www.thecave.com/archive/2002/03.aspx'>starting this blog</a> back in March 2002, I have never gone this long without a post. The longest time before now was when I made the move from New York City to Salem Mass, which was about a month between postings. This time around it has been nearly 2 full months between postings. Needless to say, I have been extremely busy in through 2 months.<br /><br />First of all, I have taken on new customer work to help pay the bills while I continue working on the product side of White Peak Software. While this has helped financially, it is taking it toll on my available time. The main reason is I am now traveling weekly. Combine this with my already busy <a href='http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/01/26/my_trips_in_2007.aspx'>travel schedule</a> and I&#8217;m left with very little time.<br /><br />Another activity keeping me busy is the purchase of a new house. Melanie and I have never owned a house before so the process is totally new for us. We found the house we really like and plan to close in December. I can&#8217;t tell you how excited we are about owning our own house and how anxious I am to be done with the buying process. It&#8217;s almost like a full time job shopping for mortgage and dealing with all the other tasks that go into buying a house. And add to that my travel schedule&#8230;<br /><br />But wait. There&#8217;s more. The new house is not the only thing we are excited about. Melanie and I will soon be parents. Yep, that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m finally going to be a daddy.</p>

        <p>My new Sprint RAZR V3m phone can play MP3 music files, so it seems only logical to me that I should be able to use MP3 files as ringtones on the phone. It turns out you can but it involves a few steps.<br /><br />The steps below are for MacBook Pro users. Windows users can probably use a similar approach but I don&#8217;t really know for sure. So please no questions about how to do this using Windows.<br /><br />First you will need an MP3 file. A ringtone only play for 30 seconds so I suggest you edit the music file down to a maximum duration of 30 seconds. I used GarageBand to edit the MP3 file down to the desired duration and to contain the sound bit I wanted as a ringtone.<br /><br />Once you are done editing the track in GarageBand, select Share &#62; Send Song to iTunes from the GarageBand menu bar. The song will be mixed, copied to your iTunes library, and iTunes will be launched. In iTunes, select the new song, which is probably playing in iTunes, and select Advanced &#62; Convert Selection to MP3. <br /><br />Congratulations. You now have an MP3 file ready to use as a ringtone.<br /><br />The next step is to copy your newly created MP3 ringtone to your Sprint RAZR V3m phone. Using Bluetooth, pair your MacBook Pro with your phone. Select Browse Device&#8230; from the Bluetooth menulet. Select your phone in the list of devices and click the Browse button. Make sure your phone has Bluetooth turned on and that you grant access to your computer.<br /><br />Assuming all is right up to this point, you should see the Browse window displayed on your computer.</p>

        <p>I love my MacBook Pro. It&#8217;s an awesome machine and OS X is a great operating system. However, I have encountered 2 problems when dealing with my Windows-base network. First problem is accessing Windows 2003 file shares and the other problem is resolving machine names on the local network. <br /><br />I still haven&#8217;t solved the second problem but today I came across the solution for the first. This blog posting by Drew McLellan gives the step by step instructions for <a href='http://allinthehead.com/retro/218/accessing-a-windows-2003-share-from-os-x'>accessing Windows 2003 file shares from Mac OS X</a>.
