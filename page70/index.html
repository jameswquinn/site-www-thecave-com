        <h2 id="day-6-return-to-blackcomb">Day 6: Return to Blackcomb:</h2>

<p>Today was the return to Blackcomb.  The snow was much better than the other day especially in the afternoon.  Blackcomb Glacier was very nice and the views were incredible.  7th Heaven was the place to be this afternoon.  The snow was soft from the warm temps and sun.  But we are too exhausted to take advantage of the conditions with multiple runs.</p>

<p>There’s nothing else new to report.  Sunny, warm weather and still no new snow.  Jonesboro, Arkansas has got more new snow this week than Whistler.  And the forecast calls for more of the same sunny weather through at least Monday.</p>

<p>Today was all about the terrain park.  The crew tried to lay down some sick tricks but each of us did get some air.  Joe got the crash of the day with his face plant jibbin’ a table top.  A round of shots went out to the crew for various reason but it was all good.  And hopefully we will have some new snow soon.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the day was seeing Tom on the slopes.  Rumors were floating around that he was never riding the sweet white stuff, but we finally saw him linking turns in Ego Bowl.</p>

        <p>Day 4: Bowl of Sweetness:</p>

<p>Still no new snow but we had new arrivals today.  Karen, Charlie, Therese, and Justin joined us on the slopes of Whistler.  Today was about the bowls as we spent most of our time in them.  The drop in to Low Roll was definitely the most challenge.  And I will be the first to admit I slid in over the lip on my butt.  Camelback and Bagel Bowl were the runs of the day where the snow was soft and bumpy.</p>

        <p>Day 3: Birthday Fondue:</p>

<p>Today was about Melanie and Blackcomb.  Why?  Because it was Melanie’s birthday and we spent most of our time today on Blackcomb.  Snow conditions are what I would call typical East Coast without the views.  Hard pack from the top of the tree line down to mid-mountain, icy and slippery from mid-mountain down.  But the alpine above the tree line is nice.  Less than perfect conditions or not, we are still having fun.</p>

<p>No “crash of the day” or “trick of the day” today.  Instead the birthday girl is due a shot of her choice.  Speaking of the birthday girl, the crew took Melanie out for <a href="http://www.canadiansnowmobile.com/">fondue</a> to celebrate her “26th” birthday.  We rode a snowcat to 6000 feet on Blackcomb.  While going back down we could see the Northern Lights in the distance.</p>

<p>Today was the first day on the slopes and we (tried to give) gave 110 percent.  The weather is warm but the snow is still good at the alpine.  Below mid-mountain is a bit slushy but that can be fun.  We covered a lot of ground on Whistler…from Symphony Bowl to Little Whistler to the Saddle to Franz’s Meadows..from the Peak to the base…we hit it all.  The only thing disappointing today was the lack of an Xbox…although for the record, the score is 3 to 3 Joe verses Kirby.</p>

<p>Joe got the shot for the “trick of the day”.  New rules for this year.  If there is no wipe out of the day that the shot award goes to the trick of the day.  Joe nailed a surf move typically of Dave…riding up the bank and kicking around the tail end.</p>

        <h2 id="day-1-the-arrival">Day 1: The Arrival:</h2>

<p>Our day started early this morning in Vancouver.  We loaded the SUV with our gear and started the drive up to Whistler.  With little to no traffic, we made it to Whistler within an hour and a half.  We dropped off the car and headed directly to the Longhorn.  6 pitchers or so later we checked into the condo.  This year’s condo is really sweet with a view over the pedestrian walkway.  Diner at the fav Caramba’s for woodfire penne and 3-cheese macaroni.  Today is all about Xbox and chillin’ out before hitting the slopes tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>There are some fun photos of Day 1 in the <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/gallery.aspx">gallery</a> including my expert pass for the terrain park…highest level baby.  Not that I will use it but it’s cool to have.</p>

I will be making daily or almost daily posting about the trip to <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/home.aspx">WASTEDBoarding.com</a> site as well as this site.  Hopefully it will not be too confusing posting the same message at two sites.  We’ll see how it goes.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2003/02/01/laptop-verses-xbox/" rel="bookmark" title="Laptop verses Xbox">Laptop verses Xbox</a></h2>

        <p>I have developed a ritual for getting through airport security that includes pulling out my laptop before I get in line.  But today was a little different because I am also traveling with my Xbox.  Naturally I expected that I would need to pull out the Xbox from its case but no!  It’s not a laptop, it’s a game console.
<br />
<br />Okay, so I don’t get this.  Why is the Xbox treated differently at airport security than a laptop.  In my opinion, the two are basically the same with regard to hardware.  Both have a hard drive.  Both have a CD/DVD reader.  Both have an ethernet card.  Both have a motherboard, built-in fan…you get the point.  What is so special about a laptop that requires one to remove it from the case while an Xbox can remain in the case.
<br />
<br />The funny part of my experience, though, was the guy reading the Xray monitor.  He could not figure out what it was; the Xbox that is.  I mentioned to him that it was an Xbox.  He joked that they were going to confiscate it, and I joked back that I would give up the laptop before I gave up the Xbox.  Now I have to tell Avanade I need a new laptop.</p>

<p>It’s the day before WASTED II and some of us have already made our ways to Vancouver.  Melanie jumped an early flight from Salt Lake City, while Joe and I commuted from the Big Apple (different planes and times though).  And even as I type this message, Tom is still enjoying his flight from Memphis.  He forgot his passport and had to take a later flight…after returning home to pick it up.  (Hint, hint: Bring your passport if you are flying to Vancouver.)</p>

<p>Melanie and I enjoyed a nice dinner and a few beers from a local brew pub.  Joe is visiting family.  Or at least I am assuming he is.  Tomorrow is the big day.  The first day of WASTED II.  Day 1!  And all we can think of is returning to the Village.  Well, Tom may be thinking “How am I going to get to the hotel now that I am 8 hours late.”</p>

        <h2><a href="/2003/01/30/searching-new-york-for-an-ipod/" rel="bookmark" title="Searching New York for an iPod">Searching New York for an iPod</a></h2>

        <p>Yesterday I decided I wanted an <a href="http://www.ipod.com/ipod/">iPod</a>, and those who know me well know that once I get something set in my mind there is no changing it.  So throughout yesterday I searched all over Manhattan for a 10gig iPod for Windows.  I hit the mega stores like CompUSA but had no luck getting my hands on an iPod.  [Side note: Don’t trust retail store web sites that claim something is in stock and available for in-store pick-up.  On more than one occasion I have stopped by the store to pick up a gadget after checking availability from the web site only to be told by the clerk at the store that the item is not in stock.  At least this has been a common occurrence for me in Manhattan.]</p>

<p>With no luck at the mega stores, I tried the Apple store in Soho.  No luck.  I pinged a friend and he suggested another local store.  I called and still no luck.  I called a number of other stores.  It seemed that New York, which has everything to offer, was completely out of new 10gig iPods for Windows.</p>

<p>So you are probably wondering why I didn’t just order the dang thing off the Internet.  Well, I am flying out tomorrow and I wanted it for my flight.  That was the driving reason for wanting to pick one up locally.  But it was not to be.  The iPod of my desires was not available in the city.</p>

<p>I basically gave up the idea of owning an iPod and at best having it with me for my trip to Whistler.  But based on a tip I received yesterday, I called The Wiz on 5th Avenue in midtown.  Low and behold they had just received 3 brand new 10 gig iPod for Windows this morning.  I put one on hold, jumped in a cab, and headed uptown straight for the store.  40 minutes later I pick up the last available iPod from that store.  Yep, in that 40 minute ride up they sold the other 2.  My lucky day.</p>

<p>So now I am the proud owner of a new 10 gig iPod for Windows and I am psyched.  I’ll get to rock out on my flights to and from Vancouver.  And I have a new way to listen to my MP3 collection while WCAV Radio is down.</p>
