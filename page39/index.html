        <p>Over the past few months I have come across various blog <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1800">posting</a> where a developer will say something like “I can’t see myself as a developer in 20 years” or “I can’t see myself writing code until I retire.”  I on the other hand can’t imagine a time when I will not want to write code and develop software.  I’ve done this for 20+ years and I’m hoping for another 20+ years.<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong.  I’m not saying I want to sit behind the keyboard every day for the rest of my life.  After all, I still enjoy my time riding snow covered slopes.  But I do see myself writing code well into my retirement years.  For me the trick is keeping the work exciting and fresh.<br /><br />When I start getting bored I find new ways to liven things up.  For instance, over the years I have switched languages a number of times.  I was a BASIC/PASCAL developer in the 80’s then I switched to C/C++.  A few years later I switched to VB followed by Delphi followed by Java.  ASP and a return to VB followed which was later replaced with C# and the .NET Framework.  And today I am writing Win32 code using Delphi.<br /><br />Other ways to make software development fresh again is to pursue new areas of interest.  Instead of writing yet another web-based application, find a project that allows you to write a desktop application.  If you have been doing in-house development for years consider a move to an ISV.  I personally find commercial software development is a different experience and worlds apart from enterprise, in-house development.<br /><br />Other ways to keep software development fresh that have worked for me:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participate on a standard committee - help change the industry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spend the next year focused on a particular technology that is new to you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with a new team and participate in a role that is new you - for instance become the QA manager if you have been a senior developer for the last few years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write your own software…and sell it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

        <h2><a href="/2005/06/05/have-broadband-will-travel/" rel="bookmark" title="Have Broadband Will Travel">Have Broadband Will Travel</a></h2>

        <p>On Friday I was working remotely in the Philadelphia area.  This is one of the freedoms of my job that I enjoy…working from anywhere in the world.  However, working from another office or even someone else’s home is not quite the same as working from my office.<br /><br />While many people these days have broadband Internet access through cable modems and DSL, not everyone has a wireless access point.  So I tend to be confined to a single room when I need Internet access.  Friday was one of those days.  <br /><br />I worked in one room which has more comfortable seating but was disconnected from the Internet.  When I needed an Internet connection, I would move to the room with the cable modem and hub.  By the end of the day I was becoming frustrated moving between rooms.  But I solved the problem by the end of the day.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/airportexpressinhand.jpg" border="0" align="right" /><br />I headed to BestBuy and bought an <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">AirPort Express</a>.  Designed to allow users to play music wirelessly from iTunes to their stereos, it also acts as a wireless USB print server and a wireless access point.  But what really makes this a great device is the size.  The device is very small and has no bulky power supply or cables.  All you need to setup the wireless access point is a patch cable, which I already carry for me on road trip.<br /><br />Whether I am in a hotel that only offers wired Internet access or a friend’s house with a broadband connection, I can now be guaranteed wireless access.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2005/05/27/xmlserialization-patent/" rel="bookmark" title="XmlSerialization Patent">XmlSerialization Patent</a></h2>

        <p>Early this week Microsoft was granted a <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,898,604.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/6,898,604&amp;RS=PN/6,898,604">patent</a> on their approach to serializing an object to XML.  While I can see how XmlSerialization provided by the .NET Framework is unique, I have mixed emotions about the patent.  For instance, XmlSerialization is probably my number one favorite feature in the .NET Framework.  I find I use it all the time.  But I now also spend a lot of development time in Delphi writing a Win32 application and I have thought about ways to implement a similar Xml serialization feature based on RTTI.  <br /><br />My concern with such a patent is that it might discourage other developers from inventing a form of Xml serialization for a different environment such as Delphi that is as flexible and easy-to-use as .NET XmlSerialization.  Put another way, if Borland decided to implement a way to store metadata about a class structure for a Win32 target and a developer used this metadata to provide a mechanism to map the object shape into an Xml schema as defined by the metadata and serialize the object into an Xml document based on that schema, would that be a violation of Microsoft’s XmlSerialization Patent?<br /><br />Also, how does such a patent effect open source efforts such as Mono?  If someday Mono is widely adapted will Microsoft want to charge developers for the use of XmlSerialization in applications using the Mono framework?<br /><br />I don’t know the answers to my questions, and as I said I have mixed emotions about the patent.  On one hand, I see how it is a unique technique for serializing objects to Xml.  On the other hand, I fear it will limit or completely eliminate a similar approach in other development environments.</p>

        <p>I took the “What Video Game Charater am I?” quiz and it said I am a Light Cycle, which is cool since I really like the movie Tron.  However it also said that if I am not a Light Cycle then I’m an Asteroid.  This is also also cool to me.  I remember staying at my cousin’s house once and playing a single game of asteriods for 18 hours straight.  We took shifts to keep the game going.<br /><br />So which am I, a Light Cycle or an Asteroid?<br /><br />&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;<br /><a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl"><img border="0" align="LEFT" width="150" height="80" src="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame/16.png" alt="What Video Game Character Are You? I am a Light Cycle." /></a>I am <b>a Light Cycle</b>.<br /><br /><br />I drive fast, I turn fast, I do everything fast. I even breakfast. I tend to confuse people with my sudden changes of heart. Sometimes I even confuse myself, which tends to cause problems. <a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</a><br />&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br /><br />&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;<br /><a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl"><img border="0" align="LEFT" width="150" height="80" src="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame/2.png" alt="What Video Game Character Are You?

Usually I keep on doing whatever I’m doing, and it takes something special to make me change my mind. <a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</a><br />&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</p>

        <h2><a href="/2005/05/24/using-3rd-party-components/" rel="bookmark" title="Using 3rd Party Components">Using 3rd Party Components</a></h2>

        <p>Knowing when to use a 3rd party component is a key to developing a software product.  The use of a 3rd party component can save count hours and allow your developers to focus on the core product.  However, the selection of the wrong component can cause many headaches and cut into developer productivity.</p>

<p>At White Peak Software, we put each component under consideration through a series of tests.  Among the things we do, we write sample applications using the component to make sure it does what we need.  And we will combine its use with other components we use to ensure no conflict.</p>

<p>Part of the goal in doing this is to ensure that the component is easy to use.  If it takes more than a few minutes to start using the component then it is not the component for us.  For instance, I recently purchased an XML parser for Delphi called <a href="http://www.simdesign.nl/xml.html">NativeXml</a>.  This component not only did what I needed but I was able to start using it minutes after reading through the documentation.  (Yes, I prefer reading through documentation before using something.) Using NativeXml, I wrote a sample application that reads language translation files stored in XML, parses the XML, and builds a resource model that is used to set static text to the appropriate translated value.  I bought the component as soon as I finished the sample application and I am now using it in a real application.</p>

<p>When looking at 3rd party components, be sure to consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the component easy to use?</li>
  <li>Is the component well documented? In many cases, I will not even consider looking at the component if I cannot download and review the documentation and help files prior to purchase.</li>
  <li>Does the component include sample code?
 -Does purchase of the component include full source code?  I will rarely buy a component that does not come with the full source code.</li>
  <li>Is the component well supported?  Is it community supported through online forums?  It is rare that I will buy a component if the vendor does not provide some type of searchable web forum or newsgroup for support.</li>
  <li>Is there a guarantee?  I have never returned a component that I have bought but knowing that I can gives me extra comfort.</li>
</ul>

        <p>I was asked to look at my sister-in-law’s PC over the weekend.  Apparently it was having problems.  I typically avoid helping others with their PC problems but thought I would since she and her boyfriend were great hosts.  <br /><br />Somehow a nasty, little virus-like program was installed on her PC.  I tracked down the source of the problem to the <a href="http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=79466">winik.sys</a>, which isn’t in fact a Microsoft driver.  This little puppy loads other programs that appear to be tracking activity on the PC and reporting information out to somewhere.<br /><br />The simple solution to the problem: delete the winik.sys file along with the directory of other programs it launches and clean up the registry.  Unfortunately the winik.sys loads as a driver and cannot be deleted while Windows is running.  No big deal I thought.  I would just boot up into a different OS and manually delete the files.  This turned out to be harder than I thought.  And harder then it should have been.<br /><br />Not having any “tools” with me, I decided I would boot up in safe mode with a command prompt.  Unfortunately this still loads the winik.sys driver.  Note that my sister-in-law is running an OEM version of Windows XP Home without any updates on it…no service packs, etc.  When this attempt failed, I created a DOS bootable disk from Windows.  I booted up the computer from the disk and to my surprised learned that the version of DOS I was running did not recognize NTFS.  <br /><br />I tried using the OEM recovery disc, but that didn’t help either.  <br /><br />My next thought was to use Linux.  I found a <a href="http://www.linuxlinks.com/Distributions/Floppy/">list</a> of floppy based distributions, but to my surprise none of the distributions I tried supported NTFS.  After spending hours trying to find ways to read an NTFS volume from another OS, I finally had to give up.  After all, I needed to get on the road and head back to NYC.<br /><br />I did learn a lot from the exercise even though I wasn’t able to remove the file from the PC.  For instance,<br /><br />1) Sysinternals has a <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/ntfsdospro.shtml">NTFSDOS</a> utility that will mount NTFS volumes and provide read/write access from DOS.  Unfortunately the freeware version is read access only so it didn’t help me solve the problem.  And I didn’t want to buy the Administration Pack just for this one problem.<br /><br />2) While the idea of a Linux distribution on a floppy is cool, there are limits to what you can do.  I realized I need to know more about Linux and possibly make my own distribution that would allow me to help family and friends clean up infected machines.  But I’ll never take the time to make a floppy distribution.<br /><br />3) I should buy this <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/frustrations/388b/">t-shirt</a>.</p>
