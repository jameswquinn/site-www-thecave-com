<p>Still no new snow but the apres’ ski is happening.  We stopped by Merlin’s for a huge order of chicken nachos and more beer.  Beer, beer, beer…it’s the only thing still fresh on the mountain.  This beer talk is making me thirsty.</p>

<p>Another day on Whistler.  Another day without new snow.  The high pressure system causing the dry, sunny days is expected to stay in place at least through Tuesday.  So we decided to make it a short day and had lunch at the Longhorn.  Little did we know people, specifically those from the National Brotherhood of Ski, would be at the Longhorn early to reserve tables for the evening party time.  By 3 o’clock the line to get in was out the door but we had our table.  The bids for our table were numerous and becoming interesting…like the woman who offered to buy us two rounds for rights to the table we left.  But we had already promised the table to another group.  Oh well.  It was still a fun, unique experience at the Longhorn.</p>

        <h2 id="day-6-return-to-blackcomb">Day 6: Return to Blackcomb:</h2>

<p>Today was the return to Blackcomb.  The snow was much better than the other day especially in the afternoon.  Blackcomb Glacier was very nice and the views were incredible.  7th Heaven was the place to be this afternoon.  The snow was soft from the warm temps and sun.  But we are too exhausted to take advantage of the conditions with multiple runs.</p>

<p>There’s nothing else new to report.  Sunny, warm weather and still no new snow.  Jonesboro, Arkansas has got more new snow this week than Whistler.  And the forecast calls for more of the same sunny weather through at least Monday.</p>

<p>Today was all about the terrain park.  The crew tried to lay down some sick tricks but each of us did get some air.  Joe got the crash of the day with his face plant jibbin’ a table top.  A round of shots went out to the crew for various reason but it was all good.  And hopefully we will have some new snow soon.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the day was seeing Tom on the slopes.  Rumors were floating around that he was never riding the sweet white stuff, but we finally saw him linking turns in Ego Bowl.</p>

        <p>Day 4: Bowl of Sweetness:</p>

<p>Still no new snow but we had new arrivals today.  Karen, Charlie, Therese, and Justin joined us on the slopes of Whistler.  Today was about the bowls as we spent most of our time in them.  The drop in to Low Roll was definitely the most challenge.  And I will be the first to admit I slid in over the lip on my butt.  Camelback and Bagel Bowl were the runs of the day where the snow was soft and bumpy.</p>

        <p>Day 3: Birthday Fondue:</p>

<p>Today was about Melanie and Blackcomb.  Why?  Because it was Melanie’s birthday and we spent most of our time today on Blackcomb.  Snow conditions are what I would call typical East Coast without the views.  Hard pack from the top of the tree line down to mid-mountain, icy and slippery from mid-mountain down.  But the alpine above the tree line is nice.  Less than perfect conditions or not, we are still having fun.</p>

<p>No “crash of the day” or “trick of the day” today.  Instead the birthday girl is due a shot of her choice.  Speaking of the birthday girl, the crew took Melanie out for <a href="http://www.canadiansnowmobile.com/">fondue</a> to celebrate her “26th” birthday.  We rode a snowcat to 6000 feet on Blackcomb.  While going back down we could see the Northern Lights in the distance.</p>

        <h2 id="day-2-a-hundred-and-ten-percent">Day 2: A hundred and ten percent:</h2>

<p>Today was the first day on the slopes and we (tried to give) gave 110 percent.  The weather is warm but the snow is still good at the alpine.  Below mid-mountain is a bit slushy but that can be fun.  We covered a lot of ground on Whistler…from Symphony Bowl to Little Whistler to the Saddle to Franz’s Meadows..from the Peak to the base…we hit it all.  The only thing disappointing today was the lack of an Xbox…although for the record, the score is 3 to 3 Joe verses Kirby.</p>

<p>Joe got the shot for the “trick of the day”.  New rules for this year.  If there is no wipe out of the day that the shot award goes to the trick of the day.  Joe nailed a surf move typically of Dave…riding up the bank and kicking around the tail end.</p>

        <h2 id="day-1-the-arrival">Day 1: The Arrival:</h2>

<p>Our day started early this morning in Vancouver.  We loaded the SUV with our gear and started the drive up to Whistler.  With little to no traffic, we made it to Whistler within an hour and a half.  We dropped off the car and headed directly to the Longhorn.  6 pitchers or so later we checked into the condo.  This year’s condo is really sweet with a view over the pedestrian walkway.  Diner at the fav Caramba’s for woodfire penne and 3-cheese macaroni.  Today is all about Xbox and chillin’ out before hitting the slopes tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>There are some fun photos of Day 1 in the <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/gallery.aspx">gallery</a> including my expert pass for the terrain park…highest level baby.  Not that I will use it but it’s cool to have.</p>

I will be making daily or almost daily posting about the trip to <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/home.aspx">WASTEDBoarding.com</a> site as well as this site.  Hopefully it will not be too confusing posting the same message at two sites.  We’ll see how it goes.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2003/02/01/laptop-verses-xbox/" rel="bookmark" title="Laptop verses Xbox">Laptop verses Xbox</a></h2>

        <p>I have developed a ritual for getting through airport security that includes pulling out my laptop before I get in line.  But today was a little different because I am also traveling with my Xbox.  Naturally I expected that I would need to pull out the Xbox from its case but no!  It’s not a laptop, it’s a game console.
<br />
<br />Okay, so I don’t get this.  Why is the Xbox treated differently at airport security than a laptop.  In my opinion, the two are basically the same with regard to hardware.  Both have a hard drive.  Both have a CD/DVD reader.  Both have an ethernet card.  Both have a motherboard, built-in fan…you get the point.  What is so special about a laptop that requires one to remove it from the case while an Xbox can remain in the case.
<br />
<br />The funny part of my experience, though, was the guy reading the Xray monitor.  He could not figure out what it was; the Xbox that is.  I mentioned to him that it was an Xbox.  He joked that they were going to confiscate it, and I joked back that I would give up the laptop before I gave up the Xbox.  Now I have to tell Avanade I need a new laptop.</p>
