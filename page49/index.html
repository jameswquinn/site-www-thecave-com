        <p>Just came across this dandy project called <a href='http://rail.dei.uc.pt/'>RAIL</a> - Runtime Assembly Instrumentation Library. RAIL provides &#8220;an API that allows CLR assemblies to be manipulated and instrumented before they are loaded or executed.&#8221; Imagine if you will loading an assembly, inspecting it, altering the IL, and executing the mutated assembly or even saving it. This has some interesting applications for aspect-oriented programming.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2004/06/01/how-to-unit-testing-implementations-of-an-interface/" rel="bookmark" title="How to Unit Testing Implementations of an Interface">How to Unit Testing Implementations of an Interface</a></h2>

        <p>I have become a firm supporter of writing unit tests for most if not all code I write, and <a href='http://www.nunit.org'>NUnit</a> is an ideal framework for implementing unit tests. But one problem I have had repeatedly is finding a good way to test specific implementations of an interface. My approach has always been to write a new test fixture for each implementor of an interface. But the problem with this approach is that I end up duplicating unit tests for each implementor, and if I need to write a new test I have to copy it to multiple fixtures.</p>

<p>As a programmer I consider myself lazy. I don&#8217;t like having to write the same code over and over. Instead I would rather write it once and forget about it. Having to write multiple test fixtures for each implementor of an interface doesn&#8217;t suit my lazy style. I need a better approach and a quick google.com search pointed me in the right direction.</p>

<p>I came across a blog from <a href='http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/'>Jonathan de Halleux</a> that talks about <a href='http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/archive/2004/05/13/206.aspx'>composite unit testing using MbUnit</a>. Jonathan presents an approach that splits the testing effort by class functionality rather than writing a test fixture for each class. This is exactly what I am looking for but as much as I like this approach and MbUnit I still have one issue. I want an approach that works with NUnit and does not require another framework such as MbUnit.</p>

<p>The development environment I have created for my customer is solid and I do not want to introduce new problems by introducing a new framework, in the case MbUnit. In other words, I do not want to change what has been currently written including the NAnt build scripts. So I did the next best thing. I took Jonathan&#8217;s design and wrote a helper class to provide composite unit testing and include this class in my unit test projects.</p>

<p>Introducing CompositeTestFixture, a class that enables composite unit testing within NUnit test fixtures. Because this is a class and not a new framework there are limitations but the limitations do not affect the unit tests I am writing today. I will discuss the limitation later in this article.</p>

<p>To use CompositeTestFixture, begin by writing your test fixtures as you normally would. In the spirit of Jonathan&#8217;s blog I will show an example that provides a test for implementors of the IEnumerable interface. In this example I will show how to test the ArrayList and Hashtable classes which both implement this interface. The only requirement in this test is that the IEnumerable instance is not null.</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Diagnostics;

using NUnit.Framework;

namespace Samples.FunWithNUnit.MyClassLibrary.UnitTests
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class EnumerableTest
    {
        [Test]
        public void GetEnumeratorNotNull()
        {
            // Write unit test here.
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to write the unit test for the GetEnumeratorNotNull test. However we must first tell CompositeTestFixture about the factories needed to create an instance of class that implements the interface to test. I call the instance of the class the implementor.</p>

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
[ProviderFactory(FactoryType=typeof(ArrayListFactory),
ReturnType=typeof(IEnumerable))]
[ProviderFactory(FactoryType=typeof(HashtableFactory),
ReturnType=typeof(IEnumerable))]
public class EnumerableTest
{
    ...
}</code></pre>

<p>Next we need to write the code that will test the implementor. The NUnit framework is going to call the GetEnumeratorNotNull method that is decorated with the [Test] attribute. This is where we call into the CompositeTestFixture helper class. A static method RunTest is provided for those who do not want to create an instance of the CompositeTestFixture class.</p>

<pre><code>[Test]
public void GetEnumeratorNotNull()
{
    CompositeTestFixture.RunTest( this );
}</code></pre>

<p>Now we write the method that will perform the actual test. This method will have the same name as the test method. The only difference is that the method signature takes a single parameter of the interface type we are testing. Note that this method is not decorated with the [Test] attribute since we do not want NUnit calling this method.</p>

<pre><code>public void GetEnumeratorNotNull( IEnumerable en )
{
    Debug.WriteLine( &quot;Testing &quot; + en.GetType().ToString() );
    Assert.IsNotNull( en.GetEnumerator(), &quot;Must not be null.&quot; );
}</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s it. CompositeTestFixture will do all the heavy work of calling the appropriate unit test method to test a specific implementor.</p>

<h2 id='how_does_this_work'>How Does This Work</h2>

<p>CompositeTestFixture will reflect on the class instances provided in the RunTest method call and retrieve the collection of ProviderFactory attributes decorating the test fixture. Each factory declared by the FactoryType property will be called to create an instance of a class that implements the type defined in the ReturnType property. In other words the factory will be used to create an instance of an implementor.</p>

<p>A factory can declare one or more methods that return an instance object. I call these methods creators since each is responsible for creating a instance of a class. Having multiple creators gives the unit test writer the option to provide implementors that are initialized differently. For example one creator might return an empty ArrayList while a second creator might return an ArrayList filled with random numbers.</p>

<p>CompositeTestFixture determines creators by inspecting the factory class type and discovering each method with a return type that implements the type defined in the ProviderFactory.ReturnType property that decorates the test fixture. Creators must be defined with a public scope and no parameters on the method signature.</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections;

namespace Samples.FunWithNUnit.MyClassLibrary.UnitTests
{
    public class ArrayListFactory
    {
        public ArrayList CreateEmpty()
        {
            return new ArrayList();
        }

        public ArrayList RandomFilled()
        {
            ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
            Random rnd = new Random();
            for(int i=0;i&amp;lt;15;++i)
            {
                list.Add(rnd.Next());
            }
            return list;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>After CompositeTestFixture calls a factory creator it calls the unit test method matching the name of the [Test] method that invoked CompositeTestFixture.RunTest( this ). In our example this is the GetEnumeratorNotNull( IEnumerable en ) method. This is repeated for each creator declared on a factory and for each factory declared on the fixture.</p>

<h2 id='limitations'>Limitations</h2>

<p>Although this approach works for many cases it is not perfect. The SetUp and TearDown methods of the fixture will only be called when NUnit calls the wrapper test method. CompositeTestFixture does not call the SetUp and TearDown methods before and after calling the internal test method, although it would not be hard to add that feature.</p>

<h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>

<p>With the CompositeTestFixture helper class, I now have an easy way to provide composite unit testing within introducing a new framework into my development environment. Hopefully you will find this code as useful as I have. Click <a href='/downloads/CompositeTestFixture.zip'>here</a> to download the complete source code.</p>

        <p>This week at TechEd, Microsoft announced <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/default.aspx'>Visual Studio Team System</a>. It includes a number of features to get development team more into the life cycle such as unit testing, profiling, and code coverage. Sounds exciting but a couple of things I have read bother me. <br /> <br />Class diagraming will not use UML. Instead Microsoft has created a new notation which Microsoft says is needed to support two-way application design. The other point that I read that worries me is that Visual Studio Team System integrates tightly with SQL Server 2005. My assumption here is that as a team tool the database used most likely has to be a centralized database accessible by all team members. However, this is just an assumption at the moment but as a developer who uses a laptop and one who does development disconnected from a network from time to time such as when flying, I wonder how this will change the development experience or worse how it will limit the development experience. Guess I will have to wait until I get my hands on the bits to see what will happen.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2004/05/19/using-enterprise-templates-to-group-projects/" rel="bookmark" title="Using Enterprise Templates to Group Projects">Using Enterprise Templates to Group Projects</a></h2>

        <p>I&#8217;m currently working on a customer project with 16+ VS.NET projects in a single VS.NET solution file. The single solution file is handy in that all the source code that makes up the complete customer solution is available in one place. The solution includes multiple C# projects, unit test projects, database projects, and one Reporting Services project. Also our build environment relies on NAnt scripts so each project that produces an assembly also has its own .build script.<br /><br />A single solution approach is nice because I have access to everything that makes up the solution, from build scripts to C# source code to stored procedures. But finding the right project or file is becoming more challenging each day as more is added to the solution. This is where Enterprise Template Projects comes to the rescue. <br /><br />An Enterprise Template Project is a project type available in Visual Studio.NET Enterprise Edition or greater, and it can contain any type of file including other project types. I started out by creating a set of enterprise template projects that represent the grouping I want. For example, I created template projects with the names Applications, BusinessServices, Databases, Frameworks, NAntScripts, and UnitTests. Within each of these projects I added the appropriate reference based on the grouping to existing project files. UnitTests contains references to the C# projects responsible for producing our NUnit unit test assemblies. BusinessServices contains references to projects that make up the middle tier of the solution. Framework contains references to framework projects, and so on.<br /><br />NAntScripts is interesting in that it does not contain a reference to another project but instead it contains references to .build scripts files found in other projects. I like this because many times when I am working on the build scripts I need to modify more than one script. Before making the grouping I was jumping from project to project in search of the .build script file. Now I have references to all the script files in one place making it easier to find a particular script file.<br /><br />With this new grouping I am able to more efficiently find the projects and files I need to work on. The grouping has proven itself to be a huge time saver for me especially when working with large single solution files.<br /><br />One additional note on using enterprise template projects to organize your single solution: To prevent scattering .etp files throughout project directories containing the source code I recommend creating a single directory that will store all of the .etp files. References within an enterprise template project do not have to fall under the template project. Instead files referenced within the .etp can be stored anywhere on the hard drive. This means the .etp file does not have to dirty up the project directory where the source code actually resides.<br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>I have been working today on stabilizing our build environment for a customer project. NAnt has been a great to so far for this. But today I wanted to start running NUnit tests of our assemblies from the NAnt script. I have tried a combination of Xml in attempts to get the NUnit task to work as expected. All assemblies except one have a configuration file so I must use the element. I have tried defining a single section with multiple elements, one for each assembly to test. And I have tried multiple sections within a single target, but the result is the same. Not all tests do not always run. <br /><br />Say I have 4 test assemblies. 2 out of the 4 may load. The other two seem to be ignored. The section seems easiest enough, but I must be missing something. Shot me a reply if you have a suggestion. Thanks.<br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>When did the term <a href='http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/coder/3817/'>code monkey</a> become inappropriate in the office? <br /><br />I was talking with a programmer who is employed by the customer yesterday and a question came up about coders. This lead to a conversation about the meaning behind terms like &#8220;coder&#8221;, &#8220;programmer&#8221;, and &#8220;developer&#8221;. All can be the same while having some differences. During the conversation I mentioned the term code monkey. The programmer I was talking to never heard of the term so I showed him the <a href='http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/c/code_monkey.html'>definition</a> of code monkey from <a href='http://info.astrian.net/jargon/'>The Jargon Dictionary</a>.<br /><br />Later that day the GM from my employer talked with me about the term, and 15 minutes later I got an e-mail from our HR Generalist requesting to talk with me about this. Apparently code monkey has become an offensive thing to say, or at least it has within the walls of my employer.<br /><br />I see nothing wrong with this phrase. I have even considered myself a code monkey from time to time. Last summer I was on a project for a customer where I got to be a code monkey and I loved it. It was one the best project I have been on since joining my employer.<br /><br />The whole situation reminds me of an episode of Recess called <a href='http://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/cartoon.cgi?film=7015&amp;cartoon=The%20Story%20of%20Whomps'>The Story of Whomps</a>. The school principal and one of the teachers deem the word &#8220;whomps&#8221; as a cuss word and set out to punish the kid who created the word. The scandal goes all the way up to the Board of Education. When the superintended learns the scandalous word is &#8220;whomps&#8221; he says something to the tune of &#8220;Anyone who hears something vulgar in the word &#8216;whomps&#8217; has a vulgar mind.&#8221; And that&#8217;s how I feel about the term code monkey. If you hear something offensive in the term code monkey than you probably have an offense mind.<br /><br /><br /></p>
