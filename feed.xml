        <title>Trying a little experiment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I want an easy way to share certain posts to social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, at the time I publish the post. The more I can automate, the better. The problem is this site is a static HTML site generated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do I automatically share a post to Facebook or Twitter? That’s what I’m experimenting with right now, and this post is my test post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-going-on&quot;&gt;What’s Going On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the techies reading this, here’s what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I updated my tags plugin to generate an RSS feed file for each tag. Next, I setup &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; to monitor the feed files for the tags “facebook” and “twitter”. When IFTTT detects a new feed file item (i.e., a new blog post), it will post the item to the appropriate social media site. If I want to share a post to Facebook, I simply tag it with “facebook”. And if I want to share the post on Twitter, I tag it with “twitter”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com&quot;&gt;source code for this site&lt;/a&gt; is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; for those who want to look under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to start work on the hard part…writing more blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Trace To Slopes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a software developer but I’m also a snowboard bum. And with the start of the 2016/2017 snowboard season upon us – that is, for those of us living in the Northern Hemisphere – I’m eager to hit the slopes. Over the last few years I’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.traceup.com/trace-for-snow&quot;&gt;Trace Snow&lt;/a&gt;, formerly AlpineReplay, to track my time on the slopes. It’s a good iPhone app but far from perfect. One feature it lacks is reporting the number of days spent on the slopes in a season. Trace isn’t alone in not having this feature. None of the ski and snowboard tracking apps I’ve tried have this feature. It seems these apps are more commonly used by individuals who only get a small number of days on the slopes, say 5 or 10 days, which is easy to count. But when you average 80+ days each season, counting the number of days can be a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it I had the pleasure of meeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://curtisherbert.com&quot;&gt;Curtis Herbert&lt;/a&gt; at this year’s 360idev. For those who don’t know Curtis, he’s an iOS developer who just happens to have written an excellent ski and snowboard tracking app appropriately named &lt;a href=&quot;https://getslopes.com&quot;&gt;Slopes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried Slopes once last year, but I wasn’t won over by it. I don’t remember the reasons, but I do remember it was lacking the one feature I really wanted, which is the see the number of days I’ve ridden in a season. I mentioned this to Curtis and before the end of the conference Slopes had a day count feature. And Curtis had a new customer. I decided right away I would use Slopes this season instead of Trace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I was bummed that I could not use Slopes to view the years of data I had collected in Trace. I mentioned this in email to Curtis and within a minute he replied telling me about Slopes’ import process. “Wow,” I thought, “he’s thought of everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately went to the Trace website to see if I could export my data, and sure enough I could. But there was a problem. I had to export each day one at a time. I’ve logged over 250 days in Trace and manually downloading each day was not something I wanted to do. So I put on my developer hat and wrote a python script that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kirbyt/trace-export&quot;&gt;downloads the GPX files from Trace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; is the perfect language for a task like this especially when combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/&quot;&gt;Beautiful Soup&lt;/a&gt;, a Python library for parsing HTML. I’ve written similar screen scraping scripts using Python and Beautiful Soup before, so writing a script that downloads the GPX files from the Trace site took me a fraction of the time it would have taken me to manually download each GPX file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my Trace data in hand I was ready to import the GPX files into Slopes, but I hit another wall. To import a GPX file into Slopes, you email the file to yourself, then on your iPhone, you open the GPX file in Slopes. This is a great process if you have one or two GPX files to import, but if you have hundreds, well, it’s less than ideal. But thankfully Curtis thought that too. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301&quot;&gt;iTunes File Sharing&lt;/a&gt; to import GPX files. Simply tether your iPhone to your Mac, open iTunes, select your iPhone, select the Apps section in the left panel, and scroll down to the File Sharing section in the right panel (thanks, Apple, for making this not so straight forward). Select the Slopes app, then drag and drop your GPX files into the Slopes Documents area. Finally, launch the Slopes app on your iPhone. Slopes was able to import all my files in a matter of seconds, and now I have all my tracked data, dating back to the 2012/2013 snowboard season, in Slopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you are a Slopes user too and you previously used Trace, you can use my Python script to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kirbyt/trace-export&quot;&gt;download your past GPX recordings&lt;/a&gt;. I open sourced it so others can quickly download their data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Slopes, I have to say it’s a great app and Curtis is awesome. He has thought of just about everything for Slopes, and for those features not in it, he seems like the type of guy who will add them if it makes sense for the app and its users. In fact one feature missing that I’ve already requested is an option to export all my GPX data from Slopes. I don’t plan to stop using Slopes anytime soon, but I would still like to see this feature on the off chance I have to make another switch in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Do A Case Insensitive Search Using Parse SDK</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across this question about searching using the Parse SDK for iOS. Simon asks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What would be the best practice for search in a large user database and return e..g 10 first results based on name or email?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing a lot with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parse.com&quot;&gt;Parse&lt;/a&gt; recently, from building a new iOS app to adding a license key &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/licenselookup&quot;&gt;lookup&lt;/a&gt; feature to my company website, and the reason Simon’s question caught my attention was because I asked myself a similar question the other day when working on the license key lookup feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The license key data comes from my order processing provider. A customer who has lost they license key can visit my website and retrieve for their license information by entering their email address. The problem, however, is that the person might enter the email address using a different case than used when the order was placed. And Parse does not have a way to perform a case insensitive search on string values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you get around this problem? And as Simon asks, what are some best practices for searching data in Parse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;force-strings-to-all-lowercase&quot;&gt;Force Strings To All Lowercase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, you should force all string values that can be searched to lower case, and do the same with the search string entered by the user. This produces the same effect as performing a case insensitive search while getting around the fact that Parse, as well as other types of data stores, doesn’t support case insensitive searches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While storing the string value in all lowercase works fine for some value types, such as an email address, it’s not ideal for other value types. A person’s first and last names are not something you want to store in lowercase only. After all, you will likely display the person’s name on a profile screen or in an email message, and you want to display the name exactly as entered by the person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you search by data such as a first or last name without the ability to perform a case insensitive search? Simple. You create a search field for each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;define-search-fields&quot;&gt;Define Search Fields&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your Parse class contains three properties, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;. All three contain data entered by a person. When you add a new instance of this class to Parse containing the data entered by the person, you can force the value for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; to be lowercase (e.g., &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-[NSString lowercaseString]&lt;/code&gt; if you’re using Objective-C). However, you don’t want to do this for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, you want to use search fields for those two properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To search on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/code&gt;, add two additional properties to your class, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;firstNameSearch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lastNameSearch&lt;/code&gt;. Then, just as you did with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;, force the values for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;firstNameSearch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lastNameSearch&lt;/code&gt; to be all lowercase before saving the data to Parse. Now when you want to perform a search, use the search properties &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;firstNameSearch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lastNameSearch&lt;/code&gt; instead of the other two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You’ve achieved case insensitive searching in an environment that does not support it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Present An Alert View Using UIAlertController When You Don't Have A View Controller</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the summer I updated a number of apps to iOS 9. A common tasks for me was replacing the deprecated &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIAlertView&lt;/code&gt; with new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIAlertController&lt;/code&gt; class. Generally this is easy to do, but there is one scenario that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIAlertView&lt;/code&gt; handles well that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIAlertController&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t support at all: displaying an alert view from parts of your code without a reference to the current view controller, for instance, displaying an alert view from the app delegate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to display an alert view using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIAlertController&lt;/code&gt; from a non-UI specific class such as the app delegate is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26952061/present-uialertcontroller-from-appdelegate&quot;&gt;common problem&lt;/a&gt;, and developers have found different &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26554894/how-to-present-uialertcontroller-when-not-in-a-view-controller&quot;&gt;workarounds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/30941356&quot;&gt;One particular solution&lt;/a&gt; that caught my eye was this one from agilityvision, who writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At WWDC I stopped in at one of the labs and asked an Apple Engineer this same question: “What was the best practice for displaying a UIAlertController?” And he said they had been getting this question a lot and we joked that they should have had a session on it. He said that internally Apple is creating a UIWindow with a transparent UIViewController and then presenting the UIAlertController on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about how I would solve the problem for apps I work on. Liking the approach mentioned by the Apple Engineer, I decided to give that a try. But unlike some of the other solutions that use a category, I decided to create a new class, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WPSAlertController&lt;/code&gt;, that is a subclass of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIAlertController&lt;/code&gt;, and provide additional convenience methods making it possible to display an alert view with a single call…like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSString *title = ...
NSString *message = ...
[WPSAlertController presentOkayAlertWithTitle:title message:message];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or display the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localizedDescription&lt;/code&gt; from an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NSError&lt;/code&gt; object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[WPSAlertController presentOkayAlertWithError:error];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, since &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WPSAlertController&lt;/code&gt; is a subclass of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIAlertController&lt;/code&gt;, you can create your alert the same way as you do using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIAlertController&lt;/code&gt;. The only difference is you call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; to present the alert when you don’t have a view controller. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSString *title = ...
NSString *message = ...
WPSAlertController *alertController = [WPSAlertController alertControllerWithTitle:title message:message preferredStyle:UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];
[alertController addAction:[UIAlertAction actionWithTitle:@&quot;OK&quot; style:UIAlertActionStyleDefault handler:^(UIAlertAction * _Nonnull action) {
  // Your code.
}]];

[alertController show];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can grab the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kirbyt/WPSKit/blob/master/WPSKit/UIKit/WPSAlertController.m&quot;&gt;source code for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WPSAlertController&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from my github repository and include it in your project, or use the entire &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kirbyt/WPSKit&quot;&gt;WPSKit.framework&lt;/a&gt; in your project if you want to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WPSAlertController&lt;/code&gt; plus other handy classes that I use when creating iOS apps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tags And Categories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing a bit of tinkering here at thecave. I realized I was using categories as if they were tags and for one simple reason. I didn’t have a way to support tags. That is, until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tag support is provided in Jekyll, but I wanted something slightly different. I want the list of tags to appear at the end of a post just like the categories have for last couple of years. I searched for different ways to support tags with Jekyll, but I didn’t find anything suiting my needs. Then it occurred to me I could tweak the category plugins I use to work with tags, so that’s exactly what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/recurser/jekyll-plugins&quot;&gt;Jekyll category plugins&lt;/a&gt; I use come from Dave Perretter. I made copies of &lt;em&gt;category_generator.rb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;category_list_tags.rb&lt;/em&gt; naming the new plugins &lt;em&gt;tag_generator.rb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tag_list_tags.rb&lt;/em&gt;. Then I replace references to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;categories&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;category&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tag&lt;/code&gt; in the source code. And BAM! I now have tag support at thecave.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code for the plugins in my site’s github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com/tree/master/_plugins&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trying Something New To Avoid Feast Or Famine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working for myself for nearly 12 years, and for the most part I love it. But there is one aspect of being an independent software developer that I could happily do without, the cycle of feast or famine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My products don’t always sell as well as I would like, so I rely on consulting work to keep my annual income at a level that allows me to provide for my family. Some years I do less consulting work than other years thanks to product sales. But other years, I must rely more on consulting to keep food on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent consulting work often times comes with the feast or famine cycle. Some months you have more work than you can handle, the feast, while other times you experience dry spells where you are not billing any hours, the famine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feast or famine is often times a result of not keeping a flowing pipeline of opportunities. But as a consultancy of one, keeping that pipeline flowing can be hard when you are focused on delivering a solution to a client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried different approach over the years to avoid the feast or famine cycle, and I continue trying new approaches each year. For instance, at the beginning of this year I agreed to work full time on a project for an agency. My hope was that by working with this agency, I would have a constant funnel of project work. However, the workload from the end-client was only part time at best, and since I was being paid hourly I didn’t earn nearly as much as I had planned&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After a number of chats with the agency, I decided it was in the best interest for everyone for me to end the relationship so I could focus on projects that would get my income level back to where it was last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m trying something else new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While combing through my leads I came across a posting for &lt;a href=&quot;http://toptal.com/&quot;&gt;Toptal&lt;/a&gt;. Topal connects top freelance developers to businesses world wide looking to hire someone for a project. Now I know what many of my friends are thinking right now, this is another one of those crappy freelancer dot com, elancer, or up-something type of sites. And Toptal may in fact turn to be like those other sites. But I won’t know unless I try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day I used guru.com to find iOS project work, and guess what? It worked and worked well. My first client iOS project came from guru, and I earned $36K off that one project. And my client became a repeat client of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the guru site work today? In my opinion, no, it does not. But at least I tried it. And that’s what I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toptal.com/app&quot;&gt;joining Toptal&lt;/a&gt;, to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Toptal works out for me and I’m able to reduce, or even eliminate the feast or famine cycle, then it’s a win win situation for everyone involved. And if it does not workout, well, I’m only out a couple hours of my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: After writing this post I learned more about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent&quot;&gt;Toptal screening process&lt;/a&gt;. Their screening process alone separates them from the other sites mentioned in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I have since learned that in this situation I should have charged a fixed weekly or monthly rate instead of an hourly rate. This would have ensured I met my earning goals while still being available to the end-client even when the workload itself was lacking in hours. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Wish I Could Help But It's Not My App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A well known global company is using some open source code I wrote in one of their apps (yay!). Like a good company, they included my name and licensing information in app’s about screen. Now I’m getting emails from one of the app’s users seeking help with the app. The person thinks I wrote the app because my name appears in the licensing section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely a first for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kicking Procrastination In The Ass</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I attended a video cast thingie today - I think the kids call it a webinar - hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amyhoy&quot;&gt;Amy Hoy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexhillman&quot;&gt;Alex Hillman&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crowdcast.io/e/procrastination&quot;&gt;Kick Procrastination’s Ass&lt;/a&gt;. It was really good, especially the first hour. If you have some spare time, I highly recommend watching it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the keys points for me included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reasons-for-procrastinating&quot;&gt;Reasons for Procrastinating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Motivation) Lack of motivation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Destination) Not really defining a specific goal. Too vague in what you want to accomplish.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Implementation) Breaking things down into small tasks, but they will be vague if the goals are vague. You need to have structure, a schedule that you stick to to over come this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-reason-for-procrastinating&quot;&gt;Other Reason for Procrastinating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The more you care about it, the harder it is to do. You are too emotionally involved. For example, it has to be perfect and since you feel like you can’t make it perfect right now, you put it off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get over the fantasy that you are great and your product has to be perfect. Ship it. Make mistakes. And learn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ship early. Example, ship when you only have 5 percent of the features complete. No one will know you didn’t ship the other 95 percent of features. (Note, the 5 percent must still be good and solve pains.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-points-and-thoughts-from-my-notes&quot;&gt;Other Points and Thoughts From My Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you had to ship today then what choices would you make?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can’t ship a time tracking system without a timer or invoicing.” Sure you can. Once you solve a pain, ship. Other features can be added later. Another example, Early versions of &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsfreckle.com&quot;&gt;Freckle&lt;/a&gt; shipped without a way to change your password. To change your password, you had to email support and have them change it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about what can you ship this month? This week? Today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When do you ship? When you kill one pain. Then kill another pain and ship. Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-one-of-my-favorite-points&quot;&gt;And One of My Favorite Points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get hung up on the long term destination, think of the short term destination to get it out the door in the near term. Note: You still want to have a long term goals, but don’t let them distract/delay from shipping today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: When Alex started &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indyhall.org&quot;&gt;Indy Hall&lt;/a&gt;, he asked friends if they wanted to meet at the same time and same coffee shop each day. It cost him nothing and that was Indy Hall for the first year. Meeting daily at a coffee shop wasn’t his long term goal, but it was a start. (If you can’t find people to meet at the coffee shop, you’re not going to attract them to your co-working space that you are paying for.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the video. Good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>You Don't Need Motivation. You Need Good Habits</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Amy Hoy answers the question “&lt;a href=&quot;https://unicornfree.com/2013/how-do-you-stay-motivated-when-youre-not-making-any-money&quot;&gt;How do you stay motivated when you’re not making any money&lt;/a&gt;”. The post is a couple of years old, but her answer is as relevant today as it was back then. It’s not about finding and having motivation. It’s about developing good habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Amy, you don’t let your kids or pets starve just because you’re not motivated to feed them. You do it anyways. And that exactly what you need to do when starting or running your business, creating a new product, or doing anything that matters to you. You just need to do it even when your not motivated to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think back to the time when I was writing the first edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.learningipadprogramming.com&quot;&gt;Learning iPad Programming&lt;/a&gt;. I was struggling to stay motivated, and I would go long periods of time (days, weeks, months) without writing a word. I read anything and everything I could find on how to stay motivated, but those tips didn’t help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What helped me was structuring my day so that I worked on my book at least an hour each day. I started work on the book at the same time every day, which was 9 am. Some days I only worked on it for an hour, other days I would work on it all day. It depended on how I felt. But I always worked on it for at least one hour starting at 9 am every day even when I wasn’t motivated to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This structure got me into the habit of writing daily. And after I developed the habit, I found writing became easier for me. And I was able to ship the book. The structure worked so well, I used it again and developed the same habit (and then some&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to ship the second edition, which I completed in a fraction of the time compared to the time spent on the first edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don’t let a lack of motivation stop you from getting things done. If you are struggling, then setup a structure that will help you develop the habits you need to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another habit I developed while writing the second edition of my book, and one I still use today, is to listen to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/kirbyt/playlist/6QUgiw9WPf8qXdgnrdXGvZ&quot;&gt;Music to Write To&lt;/a&gt; playlist on Spotify. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
