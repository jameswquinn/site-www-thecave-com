        <title>You Don&#39;t Need Motivation. You Need Good Habits</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Amy Hoy answers the question “&lt;a href=&quot;https://unicornfree.com/2013/how-do-you-stay-motivated-when-youre-not-making-any-money&quot;&gt;How do you stay motivated when you’re not making any money&lt;/a&gt;”. The post is a couple of years old, but her answer is as relevant today as it was back then. It’s not about finding and having motivation. It’s about developing good habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Amy, you don’t let your kids or pets starve just because you’re not motivated to feed them. You do it anyways. And that exactly what you need to do when starting or running your business, creating a new product, or doing anything that matters to you. You just need to do it even when your not motivated to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think back to the time when I was writing the first edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.learningipadprogramming.com&quot;&gt;Learning iPad Programming&lt;/a&gt;. I was struggling to stay motivated, and I would go long periods of time (days, weeks, months) without writing a word. I read anything and everything I could find on how to stay motivated, but those tips didn’t help me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What helped me was structuring my day so that I worked on my book at least an hour each day. I started work on the book at the same time every day, which was 9 am. Some days I only worked on it for an hour, other days I would work on it all day. It depended on how I felt. But I always worked on it for at least one hour starting at 9 am every day even when I wasn’t motivated to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This structure got me into the habit of writing daily. And after I developed the habit, I found writing became easier for me. And I was able to ship the book. The structure worked so well, I used it again and developed the same habit (and then some&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to ship the second edition, which I completed in a fraction of the time compared to the time spent on the first edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don’t let a lack of motivation stop you from getting things done. If you are struggling, then setup a structure that will help you develop the habits you need to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another habit I developed while writing the second edition of my book, and one I still use today, is to listen to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/kirbyt/playlist/6QUgiw9WPf8qXdgnrdXGvZ&quot;&gt;Music to Write To&lt;/a&gt; playlist on Spotify.  &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Retiring My CSV Editor</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I did something that I’ve been saying I will do for a long time. I retired my CSV editor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2015/08/18/killinks-retirement/&quot;&gt;Killink&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first release of Killink CSV Editor was back on March 22, 2007, and over the years it has done well despite the fact that I haven’t been actively working on the app or marketing it. Killink had great potential, especially if I had followed the business advice from those smarter than me to focus on the enterprise, but I honestly lost interest in the editor after I started writing apps for Mac and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did start work on a Mac version of Killink CSV Editor, and I have still have a semi-working version of it on my iPhone. But I struggled to create the user experience that I wanted on those two platforms. Given enough time I could have conquered the UX challenges, but I knew the market for the editor was small and spending the extra time to do what I wanted didn’t make good business sense. So the Mac and iOS versions never shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always found the customers of Killink CSV Editor fascinating. While we developer types view CSV as antiquated technology, these customers work with CSV files regularly. And most are business users from large, well known companies. We developer types often times forget that people around the world are using old technologies like CSV daily to do their job, and they too would like a better way to work with old tech like CSV files. Killink CSV Editor was a better way for many for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It saddens me to retire Killink CSV Editor, but at the same time I feel like a burden has been lifted off my shoulders. The app is rock solid and support is minimum, but I have felt guilty for a long time about selling a software product that I know isn’t actively being worked on. And with the recent Windows 10 release, I finally decided now is the time to retire my CSV editor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard many good things about Windows 10. But if I keep selling Killink to Windows users I will have no choice but to install it some day. And honestly, I don’t want to do that. I have zero interest in Windows these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do plan to continuing supporting licensed users of Killink CSV Editor, which I talk about over at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2015/08/18/killinks-retirement/&quot;&gt;company blog site&lt;/a&gt;. The support load is minimum, so providing ongoing support isn’t a concern for me. Killink is a native Win32 app built using Delphi. It’s rock solid and hasn’t had a serious issue that I couldn’t resolve in email in years. So I’m happy to continue answering questions about Killink and helping folks if they happen to run into a problem. That said, I’m not looking forward to the emails I’m going to receive when people try to buy a new license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I retired SMTP Diagnostics, another Windows app I sold for years, I received emails for nearly a year asking why it was no longer available and why I couldn’t make an exception this one time and sell a new license. Most of the time the people understood, but a few sent angry emails. I fully expect the same will happen with the retirement of Killink, and all I can say to those folks is sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retiring my CSV editor ends another chapter in my long software career. I’m a bit sad by this, but I’m also excited by no longer having the mental burden that came with having my editor sit untouched for such a long time while people were still buying licenses for it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Wish There Was Something Better Than Meetup.Com</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a Meetup.com subscriber for years, but I hate using them. Their website isn’t very user-friendly, and I often times find their messages to be misleading and or confusing. For example during the transition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nshappyhour.org&quot;&gt;NSHappyHour&lt;/a&gt; meetup, which had over 250 members, I tried to disable the account. Turns out that is not an option, or at least it wasn’t at the time. I learned that the account had been deleted when I went to re-enable the account a few days later. The only option was to start a new account. This meant we lost the 250+ members that has joined over the years, and we had no way of reaching out to those members to ask them to join the new meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that experience I decided I would not use Meetup.com again. But earlier this year I decided to start a new group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apres-code.com&quot;&gt;Après Code&lt;/a&gt;, and the best way to get the word out was to start another Meetup.com meet up. Meetup did help get the word out and people have been attending the gathering each month. But I still haven’t fully leveraged Meetup.com because the web interface is still just as confusing and crappy as ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I received yet another confusing, and misleading, message from Meetup.com that will cost a member $10, and I’m once again regretting my decision to use Meetup.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is an option with Meetup to allow members to send a contribution. I thought this option was turned off, and according to my account settings contributions were not enabled. Yet, a member was still able to send a $10 contribution. I decided not to accept the contribution because it just seems weird to me to have someone spend me money for this meet up group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed my mind this morning when I received the misleading email reminding me of the contribution. The Meetup email said, “You can choose to use it toward your Organizer Subscription.” My bi-annual subscription is due in a few days and I thought, sure, why not apply the $10 to the subscription amount. Turns out it’s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a single click of the mouse button, I started the process of accepting the contribution, but accepting the contribution means setting up a new account with some service named WePay and linking my bank account to WePay. This is not something I’m interested in doing. I know nothing about WePay. Not only that, WePay is taking $1.50 from the $10 contribution as a processing fee. That’s 15% of the contribution, which I find ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can’t Meetup take the contribution and apply it directly to the Organizer Subscription? It seems like a simple enough task. After all, Meetup has the ability to process online credit card payments. And in doing this, members like me would not need to sign up for yet another service, link a bank account to a service they know nothing about, and the full contribution amount can be applied instead of only 85%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I’m having to waste time contacting both Meetup and WePay requesting the member be refunded his contribution because Meetup misled me. And with my bi-annual subscription renewal coming up in a few days, I’m once agree debating whether I should continue using Meetup.com or not. I’m leaning towards not renewing, but I know if I don’t then they will delete the account and the members will be lost forever if I decide to renew later. And if I let the account expire before this contribution mess is resolved, the member who was kind enough to send the contribution will likely be out $10 and WePay will have an extra $10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not I renew for another 6 months or not, I will not ever use Meetup.com again for any other group in the future. The subscription is not worth the hassle. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Maintain Your iOS App With Peak App Care</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month I briefly mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecave.com/2015/07/07/ive-been-doing-it-wrong/&quot;&gt;my plan&lt;/a&gt; to productize some of the services I offer through White Peak Software. The main idea is to take a consulting service that I already offer to my clients and turn it into a product that my clients and others will hopefully subscribe to thus creating a monthly recurring revenue stream for my company. My goal was to spend no more than 40 hours over the span of a few weeks setting up this new product. And now, after spending 38.75 hours over the last few weeks, I’m ready to share more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m happy to announce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peakappcare.com&quot;&gt;Peak App Care&lt;/a&gt;. Peak App Care is a monthly subscription service for maintaining your iOS apps. What do I mean by that? Simply put, I monitor your app for crashes and fix them as quickly as possible. Not only that, I also perform small jobs such as bug fixes and enhancements to your app at your request, and I even manage the App Store for you, from updating screenshots to submitting new builds on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have found is that many apps available today in the App Store are published by companies with zero iOS developers on staff. Those companies, instead, rely on freelancers and software shops to build their apps for them. The problem, however, is that often times there’s no plans to keep the app up to date after the initial release. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when the app starts crashing or customers start reporting bugs? What happens when Apple releases a new version of iOS or a new device? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times these companies must scramble to find an iOS developer to help out. If they are lucky, the original developer is still available but chances are good the developer is currently working on something else and isn’t available for days, weeks, or even months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Peak App Care I become your in-house iOS developer responsible for the upkeep of your mobile app. I watch for crashes and fix them as they are reported. But I go beyond that. I will work with you to ensure your app remains up to date with the latest changes coming out of Cupertino. A good example of this is happening right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iOS 9 is in beta and every app publisher should be testing their app on this new iOS version. Not only that, the app should be updated to cleanly compile against the iOS 9 SDK. This means replacing deprecated code. But a company with no staffed iOS developer is often times unaware of the need to perform these types of tasks. Or they choose to ignore these tasks. After all, the app is running fine right now, so why wouldn’t it run fine when the new OS comes out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s okay to ignore changes coming from Apple, but sometimes the changes are too big to ignore. The iPhone 6 Plus is one example. Customers can quickly tell if an iPhone app doesn’t support the larger display found on the 6 Plus, and the only way to take full advantage of the larger display is to update the app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one area where Peak App Care helps app publishers. Making changes to your app to support the latest iOS release or new device is covered with Peak App Care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s the new productize service I’m now offering. Check out the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peakappcare.com&quot;&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;, and tell your friends, family members and anyone else who might be interested. Now let’s chat about how this concept came to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;giving-credit-where-credit-is-due&quot;&gt;Giving Credit Where Credit is Due&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could take credit for coming up with a totally unique concept, but the truth is a maintenance plan for software isn’t anything new. And providing this type of service for mobile apps isn’t new either. In fact, I got the idea from Einar Vollset. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einar talks about his app care service in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freelancetransformation.com/blog/building-a-recurring-revenue-consulting-business-with-einar-vollset&quot;&gt;this podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freelancetransformation.com&quot;&gt;Freelance Transformations&lt;/a&gt;. This interview blew me away. Here’s a person providing a service that is similar to what I provide, but he came up with a different way to market the service. Brilliant! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Einar’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appaftercare.com&quot;&gt;App Aftercare&lt;/a&gt; isn’t unique either. There are many other examples of this in different spaces. &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcurve.com&quot;&gt;WPCurve&lt;/a&gt; provides a similar service for folks running a WordPress site. And I’ve heard of other examples too, companies that will help you maintain your Ruby on Rails app or your Django server. So the concept of app maintenance isn’t new, but I do give credit to Einar Vollset for inspiring me to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peakappcare.com&quot;&gt;Peak App Care&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s next now that the web site is up and running? Well, it’s time for me to roll up my sleeves and start the real work…marketing Peak App Care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any product I need to market Peak App Care if it is to be a success. My first step is to let my existing clients know about this new offering, which I’ve already done. After that I need to start making others companies within my target audience aware of Peak App Care, and that is where things start to get tougher for me. Just posting a web site isn’t going to bring in customers. I must find ways to reach my target audience, and thankfully I have some ideas on how to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my company reboot, I feel this is a good first step. I don’t know if Peak App Care will be a success or not. I’m hopeful it will be. But if I fail to bring on new subscribers over the next few months, at least I won’t feel like I have wasted a lot of my time or money. This is a big switch in thinking when I compare it to the months I’ve spent in the past working on other products that either failed or were never even released into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dispatch Async to Main Queue Doesn&#39;t Work With Modal Window on Mac OS X</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a Mac app lately, and while some things are similar to iOS, something are definitely different. One thing that is different are modal windows and run loops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you display a modal view on iOS you don’t get a new run loop for the view, but when you display a modal window on OS X a new run loop is created for the window. This is not necessarily a big deal unless you have a habit of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/&quot;&gt;GCD&lt;/a&gt; to dispatch work between background and main queues. Let me give a more specific example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I display a modal view, or in the cause of OS X, a modal window. The current view is managed by a view controller. User input is captured, then a URL request is sent off to a server on the Internet. The view controller is then notified when the URL request completes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical pattern I follow for sending the request to the server and getting notified when done is to call a method that will dispatch the URL request to a background queue then dispatch to the main queue to call a block when complete. It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- (void)sendSomething:(NSDictionary *)something completion:(void(^)(BOOL success, NSError *error))completion
{
  NSParameterAssert(something);
  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
    // Send something out over the Internet.
    ...

    // All done. Assume success and error are already set.
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
      if (completion) {
        completion(success, error);
      }
    });
  });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simplified view of the pattern I often use. Call a method with a callback block. Perform some work on a background thread. When done, call the callback block on the main thread. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern has served me well on iOS, but it has issues on Mac OS X when displaying a modal window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you display a modal window with &lt;code&gt;+[NSApp runModalForWindow:]&lt;/code&gt; a new run loop is created for the window&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That might seem fine until you call &lt;code&gt;dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{})&lt;/code&gt; from a background thread. The block that you are trying to execute in the main queue will never run. And in my case, the &lt;code&gt;completion&lt;/code&gt; block is never called. This means my modal window never receives the notification that the URL request completed. (NOTE: Mike Ash &lt;a href=&quot;#update2&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that it’s not the new run loop that causes the problem.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did I work around this problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of dispatching the &lt;code&gt;completion()&lt;/code&gt; to the main queue, I call it directly from the background thread. In the completion block itself, I decide how to get the code should run in the main thread. If my window isn’t modal, then I can use &lt;code&gt;dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{})&lt;/code&gt;. But if my window is modal, which just happens to be the case for the app I’m working on, then I use &lt;code&gt;-performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:&lt;/code&gt;. So the code in my view controller looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- (void)someAction:(id)sender
{
  SomeHelper *helper = [[SomeHelper alloc] init];
  __weak __typeof__(self) weakSelf = self;
  [helper sendSomething:someValues completion:^(BOOL success, NSError *error) {
    __typeof__(self) strongSelf = weakSelf;
    if (strongSelf == nil) return;
    
    // This window is running modally with its own run loop. Therefore,
    // we cannot dispatch to the main queue. Instead, we must go old
    // school can call a selector on the main thread. In other words,
    // dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{}); does not work
    // here.
    
    NSMutableDictionary *userInfo = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
    userInfo[@&quot;success&quot;] = @(success);
    if (error) userInfo[@&quot;error&quot;] = error;
    
    [strongSelf performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(completeSendSomething:) withObject:userInfo waitUntilDone:NO];
  }];
}

- (void)completeSendSomething:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
{
    ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern change now has me re-thinking how I use certain patterns in my code, especially for code that I intend on sharing between the two platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: I posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSApplication_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSApplication/runModalForWindow:&quot;&gt;sample project&lt;/a&gt; that illustrates the problem. In writing the sample app, I learned that the scenario that causes the problem is when the modal window is presented via a block that is dispatched asynchronously on the main queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;update2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Update 2: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mikeash.com/pyblog/&quot;&gt;Mike Ash&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that NSRunLoop is reentrant but GCD serial queues are not and this is the reason, not my theory of a different event loop, the block isn’t executed. Mike said, “The main queue is already executing a block, and it won’t execute a new one until that one is done. This is a subtle way in which dispatch on the main queue isn’t the same as &lt;code&gt;performSelectorOnMainThread&lt;/code&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good to know and thanks, Mike, for explaining what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kirbyt/MacModalDispatchAsyncProblem&quot;&gt;Apple documentation&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code&gt;+[NSApp runModalForWindow:]&lt;/code&gt;: “This method runs a modal event loop for the specified window synchronously. It displays the specified window, makes it key, starts the run loop, and processes events for that window. (You do not need to show the window yourself.) While the app is in that loop, it does not respond to any other events (including mouse, keyboard, or window-close events) unless they are associated with the window. It also does not perform any tasks (such as firing timers) that are not associated with the modal run loop. In other words, this method consumes only enough CPU time to process events and dispatch them to the action methods associated with the modal window.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Boston Area Mac And iOS Dev Community Is Awesome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past Wednesday I had a chance to attend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nshappyhour.org&quot;&gt;NSHappyHour&lt;/a&gt;. It’s was my first time attending since moving to Vermont two years ago. I had a great time catching up with everyone, and I was reminded just how awesome the Mac and iOS developer community is in the Boston area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also was reminded how much I miss the community there, and since moving back isn’t an option for me - snowboard season starts in about 3 months for me - I need to make a point of visit the Boston area more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blogging The Little Things</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a post from Shubham Jain, by way of &lt;a href=&quot;http://shapeof.com/archives/2015/7/coffee_coder_-_blog_little_things.html&quot;&gt;Gus Mueller&lt;/a&gt;, about &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeecoder.net/blog/blog-little-things/&quot;&gt;blogging the little things&lt;/a&gt;. In the post, Shubham says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;There are lots of things that can be blogged about and yet, we are stuck in the dilemma of, – &quot;Is it worth something to write?&quot;. The fear of being insignificant aka &quot;Nobody will read it&quot; syndrome, inhibits us from writing that simple thing that might have helped many people.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently talked about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecave.com/2015/07/02/fear/&quot;&gt;fears&lt;/a&gt; and I mentioned some of the things I’m trying to do to help overcome those fears. And blogging more about the little things seems like another way for me to overcome some of the fears I’ve been having.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Redirect Jekyll Site To HTTPS On OpenShift</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m preparing to roll out a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; website, but unlike with my other Jekyll sites, I want each web page served up on &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;. This means telling the server to redirect &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; request to &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting this new site on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; isn’t option because Github Pages doesn’t support using a custom SSL certificate for your custom domain name. So I decided to see what it would take to host a Jekyll site on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openshift.com&quot;&gt;OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled to learn that OpenShift has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.openshift.com/quickstarts/41-jekyll&quot;&gt;quick start cartridge for installing Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; on a new gear. With a click of a button I was able to deploy my new server instance with a boiler plate Jekyll site. I replaced the boiler plate site with the one I’ve been working on, and BAM! My site was up and running. The only step remaining was to force the web server to serve up the pages using &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out this is simple to do with OpenShift and Jekyll. First, I went over to namecheap.com and purchased a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/rapidssl/rapidssl.aspx&quot;&gt;RapidSSL certificate&lt;/a&gt; with domain validation. Next, I followed the instructions from OpenShift to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-domains-ssl.html#_generating_a_csr_certificate_signing_request&quot;&gt;generate my certificate signing request&lt;/a&gt;. Using my newly generated CSR I activated my RapidSSL certificate over at namecheap, then I followed the instructions on OpenShift to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-domains-ssl.html#using-a-custom-ssl-certificate&quot;&gt;add the certificate to my server instance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point everything was easy peasy, and all I had left to do was figure out how to redirect the Jekyll site from &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;. Turns out this isn’t difficult either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jekyll website is actually just a static website hosted by Apache 2 running on an OpenShift gear. To force the redirect all I needed to do was add a &lt;em&gt;.htaccess&lt;/em&gt; file to the root of my Jekyll site source code (note: the site source code is in the &lt;em&gt;source/&lt;/em&gt; directory when using OpenShift) and put this rewrite rule in the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RewriteEngine on  
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https  
RewriteRule .* https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I added the &lt;em&gt;.htaccess&lt;/em&gt; file with the rewrite rule, I pushed my changes to the remote git repository running on my OpenShift gear. This launched Jekyll which re-built my static website, this time with each web page being served with &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including the &lt;em&gt;.htaccess&lt;/em&gt; file works great when deploying the Jekyll site to OpenShift, but approach isn’t unique to OpenShift. This should work for most Jekyll site hosted with Apache 2. And if for some reason Jekyll isn’t including the &lt;em&gt;.htaccess&lt;/em&gt; file when it builds the site, add &lt;code&gt;include: [&quot;.htaccess&quot;]&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;em&gt;_config.yaml&lt;/em&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I&#39;ve Been Doing It Wrong</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years back I was making the majority of my income from the products I sold. My apps, my book, they were all doing well. But that changed in 2013. Things came crashing down, and I found myself wondering how I was going to pay the bills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily I have a marketable skill, so I decided to focus on consulting. This was my attempt to reboot my company. The idea was to do consulting work to raise cash, then when I had enough cash I would take time off to work on my business, which in my case meant building another app or two and improving on the ones I already had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately my attempts to reboot didn’t work. Sure, I released two new apps, but once they were out the door my focus returned to billable work. I wasn’t growing and nurturing the products I had. And I wasn’t taking advantage of the momentum I had built up through the end of 2012. I stopped working on my business (again), and things only got worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I barely make any money off of the products I have. My average monthly product revenue is around $800 per month now, which is better than nothing but certainly not enough to live on. And my attempts to relieve personal stress on the consulting side of has put me into a situation where my hourly bill rate is much lower than it was a few years back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get back on track, I started listening to podcasts and reading articles and books about bootstrapping and being an entrepreneur.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; From reading posts by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unicornfree.com&quot;&gt;Amy Hoy&lt;/a&gt; to watching videos from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appreneursummit.com&quot;&gt;Appreneur Summit&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been consuming as much information as possible to figure out 1) how I got myself into this situation, and 2) how I’m going to get myself out of this situation. I’ve even started attending a mastermind group, which gives me an opportunity to talk through issues with my business and bounce around new ideas. But even after doing all this, I wasn’t feeling any better about my situation. In fact, I’ve been toying with the idea of giving up and taking a job elsewhere. But that changed two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I woke up early one morning and thought, “I’ve been doing it wrong, and I know what I need to do to correct it.” It was as if all the information I consumed about making products and being an entrepreneur had finally mashed together in a way that made sense to my brain and the light bulb finally turned on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cycle of doing full-time consulting work followed by taking time off to work on an app or other product doesn’t work for me. That is now so obvious to me. But how do I get out of this cycle and start building up the momentum on the product side again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer was right in front of my face. It’s a common theme in everything I was reading and listening to. And Justin Jackson says it best in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://buildandlaunch.net&quot;&gt;Build and Launch podcast&lt;/a&gt;, “Start small, start now.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using consulting work to save cash so I can take months off at a time to focus on building something. But what I built doesn’t make money. It’s not that the apps I’ve published suck. It’s that once they hit the App Store, my focus returns to consulting work. I’m not sticking with what I started. I’m not marketing the products I have. I’m not doing what I need to do to let more people know about them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the same time I have a wife and a kid that I must provide for and rent and bills to pay. This is why I keep returning to consulting work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do I break this cycle. It’s simple. I need to start small. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of taking two to three months off to write a new app, I need to start creating small, even tiny, products that only take a short amount of time. Once the momentum is going and I have cash coming in from product sales, I can cut back on the consulting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what products can I create now, in a short amount of time, that will get the ball rolling. Here’s what I’m currently thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productize part of the services I offer.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll share more details on this soon, but in general the goal is to take a consulting service I already offer to my clients and turn it into a product that my clients, and hopefully others, will subscribe to. Now this might seem like a huge gamble. I mean after all, generating monthly recurring income is a tough nut to crack. But it’s a small gamble for me in that I will not spend more than 40 hours over the span of a few of weeks getting this setup. If no one subscribes, I’ve only lost a week’s worth of my time. But if just one company signs up, I’m that much closer to getting back on track.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start publishing ebooks.&lt;/strong&gt; While I don’t love writing I do enjoy it a lot, and frankly, I miss it. But writing a big book like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.learningipadprogramming.com&quot;&gt;Learning iPad Programming&lt;/a&gt; took too much out of me, so this time I want to do it differently. I want to keep it small. Again, I’ll share details later but the plan is to create highly focused, short ebooks on specific topics. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video tutorials.&lt;/strong&gt; This is something I’ve explored in the past, and it’s something I want to explore again. But this time I want to do it under my control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t suspect any one of these ideas to make a ton of money, but that’s not the goal. The goal is to start small and start now so I can build momentum. And if any one of the products fail, then I’ve only lost, at most, a few weeks of my time. Besides, pursuing these small product ideas will not be a failure anyways even if they don’t earn a single cent. That’s because I will be learning a lot more about marketing and building a personal brand. And once the momentum does grows I can turn my attention back to my apps with new found knowledge on how to market and grow those apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck, and stay tuned to see if I succeed or fail in the coming month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m not a fan of calling myself an entrepreneur because I don’t think of myself as one entrepreneur. But I am a business owner, and I have been for nearly 12 years, so I guess that makes me an entrepreneur. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
