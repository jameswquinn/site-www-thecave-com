        <title>Fear</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been struggling to release new things out to the public, things such as blog posts, open source code, a new website and service I want to offer, even updates to some of my apps. What’s worse is that a number of these things are done and are just sitting on my computer. For instance, I’ve been using an updated version of Cross Post for nearly two months that isn’t available in the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why haven’t I pulled the trigger on these things and released them to the public? Fear, that’s my answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m letting fear get the best me recently. I fear what people might say or think of the work I’m going. I fear that friends will start looking down on me. I fear that I will end up looking like an idiot. The funny part is I don’t have a fear of failing. You learn from failure. But for some odd reason I have developed a fear what others, especially friends, will think. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;out-of-character&quot;&gt;Out of Character&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fear of what others will think is completely out of character for me. For most of my life I’ve had a “I don’t give a fuck what other think” attitude (and that’s exactly how I’ve always put it). I was the high school weirdo with dyed hair and strange clothes. I was the nonconformist who would occasionally wear a polo shirt just to throw off my small circle of friends. In college I had a my racquetball racquet strung with bright hot pink strings, which led to some heated confrontations with others&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The point here is I didn’t care what others thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember an evening years ago when my dad refused to go out to dinner with me because of the way I was dressed. He said I embarrassed him. I argued that he was being ridiculous because 1) it wasn’t him that was dressed up like a Boy George reject and if anyone should be embarrassed it should be me (though I wasn’t), and 2) if I don’t care what people think about me, then why should he care. If anything people will feel sorry for him for having to sit with me at a restaurant. My argument didn’t change his mind and our dinner plans were canceled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if this fear is out of character for me, then where is it coming from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-is-it-coming-from&quot;&gt;Where Is It Coming From&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know my fear is irrational when I think about it. But it’s still there and I can’t seem to shake it. Recently I’ve been putting a lot of thought into where this fear is coming from, and I think I might know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been much more isolated since moving to Vermont. I don’t have the social circle of independent software developers and business owners around me like I did when I lived in New York City and the Boston area. Most of my social interactions these days involved talking about snowboarding and hiking, not on product releases, marketing, and growing a business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving to Vermont I attended a number of social gatherings where I could talk about and share my ideas. These groups were great and always provided excellent feedback. I always listened to what others had to say, but I didn’t always follow their advice. For example, I released a CSV editor for Windows years ago and made a good money from it for a number of years even though all my software dev friends said not to do it. Still, talking about the ideas with other on a regular bases always felt good, but I no longer have a local circle of friends and peers like I did before. And I think that is why I’ve developed this fear inside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I didn’t care, for most of my life, what others thoughts, hearing what others had to say, both good or bad, always helped me. But in my recent isolation I rarely, if ever, get feedback from others. Hearing “you suck” motivated me to do better. Hearing “that’s awesome” in encouraged me to do more. But hearing nothing, no feedback at all, for long periods of time has caused this fear to grow inside of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-over-the-fear&quot;&gt;Get Over The Fear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know my fears are irrational, but I can’t seem to shake them. So I’m trying a few new things in my attempts to get over the fear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to build a small community here in Stowe (though I think about giving up each month). A few folks do join me each month, but the group is not the same as the ones I participated in before coming to Vermont. Like the gatherings I attended before, this new group is made up of mostly software developers. But what is missing for me are the independents, the business owners, the solopreneur that were common in the circles I had when I lived in NYC and Boston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also participating in a bi-weekly mastermind group. This is going well, and in fact, it was on a recent mastermind call that I realized I’ve developed this irrational fear. My fear came up again last night in an email exchange with a friend who is doing a far better job of shipping than me. Talking about my fear with others as well as what I’m working on and my goals is starting to help me return to my old self, but I need to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I’m interested in trying but I haven’t started yet is working with an accountability partner. The concept is simple. You and your partner help each other keep weekly commitments. Once a week you and your partner chat about the previous week’s accomplishments and the current week’s goals. When goals are not met, you analyze and talk through what happened. Having someone hold me accountable each week will help get me back into the habit of releasing things, which in turn will help me get over my fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other thing I am doing in my attempts to shake the fear is to leave my quiet “cave” here in Stowe and get back into interacting in person with peers. To get things started, I agreed last week to speak at a small conference in October (more on this later). Just knowing I have this speaking event coming up should help reset my brain back to where it once was, or so I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you having or had the similar fears? What sort of things are your doing to get over it? Fire off an email to me or send me a tweet and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To this day I still don’t understand why people get so worked up over something so silly such as the string color of a racquetball racquet or the appearance of others. Just because it’s not something you would do, wear, or whatever doesn’t mean you need to hate on the other person. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Tips To Being More Focused</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I tweeted the other day that “I have the problem of wanting to do too many things at once, which is distracting. It’s time for me to learn how to scale back and focus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/420/18776596119_d03e98a590_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true. Right now there are a number of things I’m working on and there are even more things that I want to work on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been bouncing back and forth between a number of projects, but I haven’t been very productive. I start work on a task but before I finish I let myself get distracted with another task. For instance, I’ll work on a client project and before I finish the task at hand I’ll jump to another task from another project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t always worked this way, and I’m not sure why I now struggle to stay focused. It could be the changing of seasons. I had my daily routine dialed in during the winter months, but something has changed recently and it’s not just the seasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe my struggle with focus is a sign of being burnt out, maybe it’s the type of projects I’m working on - I’m certainly less excited about certain projects while much more excited about others. Maybe it’s because the kid is out of school and my work day is broken up into smaller chunks than during school time. Or maybe it’s a combination of all of the above. All I know for sure is that I find it difficult to focus, so last week I set out to find new ways to get focused and stay focused&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And here’s what I came up with…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-check-email-first-thing-in-the-morning&quot;&gt;Don’t Check Email First Thing In The Morning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have stopped checking email first thing in the morning. This is probably one of the hardest habit for me to break, but I’ve come to realize that checking email first thing in the morning leads to the biggest distractions for me. So it is a must change habit for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a typical day I start the morning excited about what I’m planning to do during the day only to have that excitement squashed because of emails. The emails will often times change my plans for the day. Emails, in other words, control my day when I should be controlling my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of checking email at the start of the day I now check it later in the morning, usually just before I break for lunch. This gives me a chance to really focus on the work at hand and not let my day get off on the wrong foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit this hasn’t been the easiest change for me to make. I’ve become accustom to checking my email as soon as I wake up…often times while still in bed. But I recognize that checking email first thing each morning typically controls the rest of my day. It causes me to change the priorities I set the evening before, which in turn makes me feel like I didn’t spend nearly as much time on the most important tasks for the week. That’s why I’ve stopped checking email first thing each day and I have replaced that habit with the next tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-whats-most-important-first&quot;&gt;Do What’s Most Important First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of checking email at the start of my day, I begin my work day by working on the task that is most important for the day. It could be bug fixes for a client’s app, work on a new landing page, writing a blog post, or adding a new feature to one of my apps. I decide the night before what is the most important thing to do and that’s the first task I work on the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been following this tip for only a few days, and so far I feel more productive. Plus I feel a greater sense of accomplishment at the end of the day because that task that was most important got the love it deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend get into the habit of starting your day by doing the most important task first. If you are writing a book, start your day by writing. If you are working on a client project, and have a upcoming deadline, start your day by working on the project. And remember to work on this important task before you check your email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the biggest changes I’ve made to my daily routine, and I’m seeing immediate results. But I decided to try a couple of more things to see if I can make more improvements to my focus and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;limit-meetings-to-tuesday-and-thursday&quot;&gt;Limit Meetings to Tuesday and Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next tip is to limit meetings with others to two specific days each week. For me those two days are Tuesday and Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit to doing this is to give me more control over the other days of the week. I can use those other days to focus on productive work without the disruption of meetings. Meetings are, after all, disruptive to a productive day. Nothing kills my productivity faster than having to stop what I’m working on to waste time in a meeting. And yes, most meetings are a waste of time. Even the ones that are not a complete waste of time do waste some time. That casual chit chat at the beginning of the meeting, for example, is unproductive time. So I’m limiting those periods of unproductive time to two days a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that this isn’t something everyone can do. Heck I’m not 100% sure I can make it happen for me. But if you work for yourself and/or have control over your schedule, then you should be able to make this happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if you are like me, you already have meetings on your calendar. I, for example, have a recurring client meeting every Monday and Thursday mornings, another client meeting on Monday afternoon, one on Wednesday morning, and just recently a client asked to do a daily stand-up meeting each morning&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This means there will be a transition period for me as I get my meetings re-scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday. But this is something I’m going to make happen come hell or high water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pomodoro-technique&quot;&gt;Pomodoro Technique&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if not checking email first thing each morning isn’t already a big change to my daily routine, I’ve decided to give the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pomodorotechnique.com&quot;&gt;Pomodoro Technique&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pomodoro Technique is simple. You set a timer for 25 minutes and during that time you focus on a particular task. When the 25 minutes are up, you take a 5 minute break. Then you start another pomodoro, setting the timer for 25 minutes; focus, focus, focus; then take another 5 minute break. After four pomodoros you take a longer break (15 to 30 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard about the Pomodoro Technique a number of times over the years. I felt the process was not for me, but since focus has become a recent problem for me I decided to give it a try. So far the small blocks of 25-minute work cycles is working well for me given the amount of distractions that can happen throughout the day especially when my wife and kid are home. With the Pomodoro Technique I focus for 25 minutes, then I can use the 5 minute break answer a question my wife might have or see the latest LEGO creation my son has built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if this technique will work for me long term. And I should mention I’m not following the Pomodoro Technique by the book either. There are times when I reach the end of my 25 minute work cycle and I don’t want to stop. So I don’t. I skip my 5 minute break, and I continue working using a new pomodoro. But I do force myself to take a break after the second pomodoro when I combine two of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-these-tips-really-work&quot;&gt;Do These Tips Really Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do these tips really work? It’s hard for me to say with absolutely certainty that they work. I’m seeing some positive results already, but only time will tell what works and doesn’t work for me long term. And obviously not every tip will work for every person. Heck, I’m not sure if all the tips will work for me. But these are the tips I’m trying right now, and after only a few days I’m seeing good results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m getting more done faster, and that feeling of being overwhelmed that I got at the end of each day has been replaced with a greater sense of accomplishment and a feeling of being more productive. But the real test for me will be following these tips for a month and see what happens. Trying these tips for a month is the only way I will know what works and doesn’t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll post an update on my progress in a few weeks. Meanwhile I encourage you to give one, some or all the tips a try to see what works for you. And let me know how it works out for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Yes, I see the irony in that my search for ways to become more focused distracted me from the work that I needed to do last week. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I personally think daily stand up meetings, like most meetings, are a waste of time, and it’s certainly not a productive use of my time. A daily status email is far more productive in my opinion, and you have the report captured for historical purposes.  &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Video of Stowe, Vermont</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Ashley came across another video of Vermont. This time it’s about Stowe, the town I live in. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Essence Of Vermont</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise I love living in Vermont in part because it’s different from other places I have lived. And this video from Skyworks really captures parts of why I love it here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Do I Need Another Twitter Account</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier tonight I setup a new Twitter account that tweets a link each time I publish a new post here at thecave.com. The new Twitter account is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thecave_com/&quot;&gt;@thecave_com&lt;/a&gt;. Of course now that this is setup, I’m wondering…Do I really need a separate Twitter account, or should I just tweet the links from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kiryt/&quot;&gt;@kirbyt&lt;/a&gt; account?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I will keep the two separate accounts, and I’ll retweet via @kirbyt any links that I feel might be of greater interest, which is basically what I’ve always done. So if you want to know each time a new post is published, follow @thecave_com. Otherwise just keep doing what you’ve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>thecave On Twitter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Uli &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uliwitness/status/600656348272001024&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do you have a Twitter feed that lets me know when you post something new?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only took me a month, but I finally have a Twitter account for thecave. Follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thecave_com/&quot;&gt;@thecave_com&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter if you want to know when I post something new to this blog. And as always you can subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecave.com/feed.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer feed readers over Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-technical-how-to&quot;&gt;The Technical How To&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few different ways to automate the process of posting a link on Twitter when you publish a new blog post. &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitterfeed.com&quot;&gt;Twitter Feed&lt;/a&gt; is one service I tried. It is fast and easy to setup, and it includes options such as including the title, description, or title and description in the tweet. Even though Twitter Feed is a cinch to setup, I decided to go with &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/&quot;&gt;If This Then That (IFTTT)&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using IFTTT create a new recipe. Select &lt;em&gt;Feed&lt;/em&gt; for the trigger and &lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt; for the action. Be sure to connect your Twitter account to the IFTTT if you have not already done so. And that’s it. Next time you make a blog post, IFTTT will update your Twitter account with the title and link to the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uliwitness&quot;&gt;@uliwitness&lt;/a&gt; for suggesting I do this.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building An App From Start To Finish</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Amy Hoy wrote the first version of her book &lt;a href=&quot;https://unicornfree.com/just-fucking-ship&quot;&gt;Just Fucking Ship&lt;/a&gt; in 24 hours, which is awesome. Along those same lines, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_davidsmith&quot;&gt;David Smith&lt;/a&gt; built an app from start to finish in about 6 hours - also awesome, and he posted this video that shows the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-video&quot;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rEkuRFO6xTw?color=white&amp;amp;theme=light&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these, the book and the app, are motivating me to do more faster. I just need to stop letting excuses and fear of not being perfect get in my way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>It&#39;s Better To Try An Idea</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite quotes about shipping:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s better to try an idea and see if it works than worry too much about its potential and never ship. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_davidsmith&quot;&gt;@_davidsmith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Stuck Working For Others</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love this quote from Amy Hoy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you only do what pays immediately, you will be stuck working for other people. Or you will be stuck doing what other people want you to do…forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quote come from her talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://unicornfree.com/2015/be-your-own-angel-a-revenue-model-for-slow-startups?inf_contact_key=33d23f3cc326dbb9432ca21551e5c05960ba9e460978b642f3bc69a5e6171317&quot;&gt;being your own angel investor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where I Blog These Days</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently, and “recently” as in the last couple of years, cut back on the number of blog sites I have. I’m down to three sites now, and that seems manageable. The sites are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecave.com/&quot;&gt;thecave.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  That’s this site. It’s my personal blog, and it’s where I post most often. I talk about everything from what’s going on with me personally to snowboarding to programming. The site is broken down into categories, and I have plans to publish an RSS feed for each category so readers can filter out topics they might consider noise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/&quot;&gt;blog.whitepeaksoftware.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  This is my company blog site. The focus of this site is to talk about the company and the products I sell. Granted I’m doing a horrible job at keeping up with the posts. That’s probably one of the many reasons my stuff doesn’t sell as well as it did a few years back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rowanturner.net/&quot;&gt;rowanturner.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Yep, my son has his own website. But he has no interest in making posts here, so I do it for him. I usually post pictures and videos of Rowan and his friends off having fun. My mom might be the only person reading this site regularly, but that’s fine. I’ll keep posting because I like looking back on past articles and reliving fun moments with my kid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sites each have RSS feeds, so you don’t have to remember to visit. And some day I’ll do a better job of mentioning when new posts are available on the various social networks for those who don’t want to subscribe to the feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
