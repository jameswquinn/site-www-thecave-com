    <h2><a href="/2008/03/14/a-review-of-cvs-clients-for-mac-os-x/" rel="bookmark" title="A Review of CVS Clients for Mac OS X">A Review of CVS Clients for Mac OS X</a></h2>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been a Mac user for a little more than 6 months now, and while I&#8217;m still writing software for the Windows platform, I&#8217;m toying with the idea of targeting OS X for an upcoming product. The use of version control software is part of the software methodology used at <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/'>White Peak Software</a>, and the version control software I used is CVS (Concurrent Versioning System).<br /><br />Why CVS instead of Subversion? Simple. I have been using CVS since early 2000. It works for me and I see no reason for moving to Subversion. If I were starting from scratch I would most likely select Subversion for versioning control, but that&#8217;s a different story for a different blog post. This blog post is about my review of the various CVS clients available for Mac OS X.<br /><br /><a href='http://www.tortoisecvs.org/'>TortoiseCVS</a> is the CVS client I use on Windows and is by far, in my opinion, the best Windows CVS client out there. This of course is what I used as a baseline for finding a CVS client for the Mac. The CVS client I use needs to be as good as, or close to, TortoiseCVS. My preference for a CVS client for the Mac would be one that provides a Finder like user interface and uses right-click popup menus to interact with the CVS repository. That&#8217;s what I went searching for and here is what I found:<br /><br /><b>Xcode</b><br /><br />Xcode from Apple has an SCM repository feature that works with CVS, Subversion, and Perforce. I like the approach used in Xcode but I wasn&#8217;t able to get it working with my CVS repositories. The first problem I encountered was the lack of sserver support. The workaround for this is to use CVSNT instead of CVS, which comes installed by default on OS X. Unfortunately Xcode has a problem with sending the password to CVSNT and since CVS doesn&#8217;t support sserver Xcode was quickly off my list of CVS clients to consider.<br /><br />For grins I decided to enable pserver on one of my CVS repositories to test Xcode with CVS. Unfortunately I ran into more problems. For starters, there is no way (that I can find) for specifying a module. Secondly, when I was finally able to get Xcode to checkout a complete repository it would crash Xcode. I was testing with a rather large repository and the crash happened after about 20 minutes of download time. I tried this 3 times and the crash happened all 3 times. So even if Xcode did work with CVSNT and I was able to use sserver, I still could not use Xcode as my CVS client.<br /><br /><b>MacCvsX</b><br /><br />The next CVS client I tried was <a href='http://cvsgui.sourceforge.net/'>MacCvsX</a> (version 3.3 beta 2). This client has no problems accessing my CVS repositories but I found the UI to be a bit cumbersome. Also, I didn&#8217;t like the fact that when I wanted to add lots of new files to the repository I had to select each and every file individually. There is no &#8220;Add Content&#8221; feature like that found in <a href='http://www.tortoisecvs.org/'>TortoiseCVS</a>. While I can do everything I need to using MacCvsX, I found it UI to be inefficient. Thus my search for a CVS client for Mac OS X continued.<br /><br /><b>MacCVS Pro</b><br /><br />I looked at <a href='http://www.maccvs.org/'>MacCVS Pro</a> next, but I never downloaded it. The <a href='http://www.maccvs.org/status.html'>revision history</a> shows the last update to be March 27, 2000. That&#8217;s nearly 8 years without an update. I doubt it will run on my Intel-based MacBook Pro so I didn&#8217;t bother to download it.<br /><br />After more searching I discovered that the MacCVS Pro website at maccvs.org is out of date and no longer maintained, but the project lives on at SourceForge.net. The up-to-date <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/maccvspro/'>MacCVS Pro</a> can be found at <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/maccvspro/'>http://sourceforge.net/projects/maccvspro/</a>. The latest update at the time of this writing is January 14, 2007. Ah, much better. I did download it but I never ran it. According to the release notes in the readme file the latest build of MacCVS Pro &#8220;will only run on PPC machines (and Intel machines via Rosetta).&#8221; And the readme goes on to say &#8220;This is likely the last version that will be built using CodeWarrior, since CodeWarrior is no longer commercially available.&#8221; So MacCVS Pro is not the CVS client for me.<br /><br /><b>MacCVSClient</b><br /><br />The next CVS client I looked at was <a href='http://www.heilancoo.net/MacCVSClient/'>MacCVSClient</a> version 1.10. Now this product is more to my liking especially after looking at the other options. It works well with my CVS repositories and I like the concept of opening a sandbox to get a hierarchical view of the files. I also really liked how the hierarchical view automatically refreshed to reflect the most recent changes to the sandbox area and files within the sandbox. What I didn&#8217;t like was the diff viewer. While usable it wasn&#8217;t what I have become accustom to. I prefer the split window approach when viewing differences between files. Still, MacCVSClient is an excellent choice for those looking for a free CVS client for the Mac.<br /><br /><b>SmartCVS</b><br /><br />My search to find the ideal CVS client for Mac OS X lead me to <a href='http://www.syntevo.com/smartcvs/'>SmartCVS</a> from Syntevo. SmartCVS as a very clean, modern looking user interface. It provides different views of the sandbox. It allows me to easily checkout specific modules instead of the complete repository. As a matter of fact, SmartCVS has a project manager that allows me to save the settings for a particular module. I found this feature to be really cool and handy. And even though it does not have the &#8220;Add Contents&#8221; feature found in TortoiseCVS, SmartCVS does make it easy to add large sets of files to a repository even when the files are contained within subdirectories.<br /><br />SmartCVS comes in two favors, Foundation and Professional. Foundation is free but it does not include all the features found in the Professional version (click <a href='http://www.syntevo.com/smartcvs/comparison.html'>here</a> for the features comparison chart). The Professional version is affordable costing only $79 USD for a single user license and discounts for multi-user licenses.<br /><br />My only complaint with SmartCVS at the moment is that Syntevo needs to improve its <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization'>SEO</a>. I didn&#8217;t find SmartCVS in my initial searches and had I not spent a few nights in a row looking for CVS clients I probably would have never found it. <br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />In my opinion and based on my needs, SmartCVS is the best CVS client available for the Mac. It lacks some features that I have come to expect with TortoiseCVS <strike>such as the ability to use the diff and merge tools of my choosing</strike>, but it definitely has unique features that I like such as the Project Manager. So if you are looking for a good CVS client for the Mac, give SmartCVS a test drive.<br /><br /><font color='red'>\[Update\]</font> Turns out SmartCVS does allow users to specify external file diff and merge tools. The options are found under Preferences.</p>
