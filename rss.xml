                <title>Made Some Fixes To The Blog Site</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Before doing some work today I decided to make some improvements to my blog site. I thought I would be playing with the site for only an hour or so, but instead it took most of the day. Typical when dealing with programming issues in an unfamiliar environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com&quot;&gt;my company blog site&lt;/a&gt;, uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to generate a static HTML version of the site that is in turned hosted on a server for your viewing pleasure. I noticed a while back that categories with embedded spaces, such as &lt;em&gt;cross post&lt;/em&gt;, weren’t accessible from the categories list. The embedded space was being replaced with a dash. Also, the RSS feed was not including the time of the post, only the date. So I set out to fix these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with the time problem first. I learned that Jekyll does not include the time of the post unless you include the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the front matter. Adding the parameter is easy enough to do, but I decided I wanted to make it even easier for me. So I created a Rakefile that has a &lt;code&gt;new_post&lt;/code&gt; task. I could have used an existing Rakefile, maybe even the one from Octopress, but I decided it would be more fun to write my own. Turns out writing a Rakefile is pretty simple, and I had my &lt;code&gt;new_post&lt;/code&gt; task working quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;new_post&lt;/code&gt; task I wrote create a new markdown file for the post. The task also generates the YAML front matter for the post including the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; parameter with the current local time. This solves my time problem in the RSS feed for new post. I thought about making a fix for older post, but I decided it wasn’t worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Rakefile to create a new post makes so much sense that I decided to add a &lt;code&gt;deploy&lt;/code&gt; task the Rakefile. I’ve been using a shell script I wrote a few years ago to generate the Jekyll site then commit it to the &lt;em&gt;gh-pages&lt;/em&gt; branch of the site’s git &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it would be a fun exercise to re-implement this in the Rakefile. At the same time I decided to change how the files are committed to the branch. Instead of working from a single local git repo, I decided to clone the repo to a second &lt;em&gt;_deploy&lt;/em&gt; directory, then copy the &lt;em&gt;_site&lt;/em&gt; files to that directory. Turns out this was fairly simple to do as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that work out of the way I turned my focus to the categories name problem. Turns out it was caused by a space replacement in the Jekyll plugin I use to generate the categories list. That was the easiest, fastest fix of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a smile on my face and feeling of success I decided to do one more thing. I decided to update my install of Jekyll. And this is when everything fell apart. The sense of success and feeling of being productive evaporated quickly. Long story short, turns out I had rvm and rbenv installed at the same time, and apparently having both installed at the same time causes problems when updating gems. Unfortunately it took me a long while to figure out what had happened. I didn’t realize rvm was installed, but once I did I uninstalled it. I did another update and made sure I had rbenv-gem-rehash installed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is well now. In fact, the only reason I’m writing this post is to make sure everything is working as expected. And now that I have a faster way to create new posts, I’m hoping to post here more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
