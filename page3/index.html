        <h2><a href="/2014/04/24/family-influence/" rel="bookmark" title="Family Influence">Family Influence</a></h2>

        <p>Over on ADN, Manton Reece <a href="https://alpha.app.net/manton/post/29056754">posted</a> a link to <a href="https://thedistance.com">The Distance</a>, a new online magazine about “long lasting businesses and the people behind them”. Manton’s post included this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting a business is the easy part. Staying in business for a while is harder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This got me thinking about <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">my own business</a>, which has been around for more than ten years. More importantly it got me thinking about the family influences in my life that unbeknownst to me, until recently, led to me working for myself. I have often shared the story about how the <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2013/11/27/woohoo-white-peak-software-is-10-years-old/">idea to start White Peak Software</a> came about, at a swim-up bar during my honeymoon, but I’ve never really talked about the family influences that helped lead me down the path of becoming a business owner. The reason for this is simple. It never occurred to me until recently.</p>

<p>My grandfather (my dad’s dad) was a successful business owner running his own lumber company for many years. My dad owned a general maintenance company. My aunt’s husband (my dad’s sister’s husband) opened <a href="http://www.jamesmiddletonjewelers.com">James Middleton Jewelers</a> back in 1955, and the store is still in business today run by my cousin Vickie.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship was, and still is, common on my mom’s side of the family as well. My mom and her sisters opened and ran their own hair salon for a short period of time. My mom’s oldest sister’s husband ran his own accounting firm that is still in business today and still run by family members. My mom’s youngest sister, Beth and her husband Jay, owned Gary’s Ice Cream and Deli, the place of my very first “real” job, and later Mikey’s. My sister Renay’s husband has his own pressure washing company, and my grandmother, Dot, made and sold crafts.</p>

<p>I grew up surrounded by family members pursuing their own dreams and making their own destiny. Some were, and still are, successful in their business endeavors while others were not so lucky. But even the unlucky ones tried. They took the chance at running their own business. And all of this has had a huge impact on me even though I did not realized it until recently.</p>

<p>Thank you to all my family members who have influenced me directly and indirectly with their entrepreneur spirit. <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> would not be here, and I would be living the life I live today if not for your influence.</p>

        <p>I pierced my ear when I was 16 or 17 years old. I did it myself on the way to school. I stopped by my mom’s place to pick up my little sister. While my mom was busy getting my sister ready, I grabbed two ice cubes from the frig, and I used them to numb my ear lobe. Then I took a piercing ear ring, the kind with a pointy end, and shoved it through my ear lobe. It made a pop sound as it pushed through the backside of my ear lobe. I felt nothing. It was easy peasy.</p>

<p>I don’t remember if it was later than day or the next when my dad found out. Needless to say, he was not happy. In fact he was very angry with me. As he shared his disappointment with me, he told me having my ear pierced was just a fad and that I would soon regret it. Well, 30 plus years later I’m still wearing earrings and I still have no regrets.</p>

        <p>When I lived in NYC I organized and ran events for computer geeks like me. It was a lot of fun, and a great way to meet new people. Then I moved to Salem, Mass, a suburb of Boston, and again I organized and ran events in Salem and Boston. And again it was a lot of fun and a great way to meet new people.</p>

<p>I now live in Stowe, Vermont, and as of right now I have zero desire to organize and run events for like-minded computer nerds. After being so involved organizing meetups and such for over 10 years, it’s nice to take a break. That said, I sometimes wish someone had a tech-focused garthering in Stowe. I wonder how long before I end up organizing something.</p>

        <p>I decided to go back to cross posting between ADN, Twitter, and Facebook. I’m not as active as I once was on any one of these social networks, so I figured cross posting won’t cause too much noise in the streams of followers. </p>

        <p>I’m having a really bad day today. First, I had to rush to get Rowan to school. He was being his normal slow self, but thankfully we made it there before the bell rang. Then I get to the hill to ride the new snow when I realized I left my snowboard gear at home. So back home I go. But I had to drive behind a plow the entire way home turning a 15 minute drive into a 25 minute drive. And now I have to drive with the stream of traffic back up the hill. </p>

<p>Don’t you just hate days like today.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2014/01/17/day-25/" rel="bookmark" title="Day 25">Day 25</a></h2>

        <p>Today marks my 25th day snowboarding this season. While this might sound awesome, it’s fewer days than I was hoping to have by mid-January. I snowboarded 21 days up through Christmas. That means I have only snowboarded 4 days since Christmas, which is why I thought I would have more days by now.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons I’ve only gotten in 4 days over the last 3 weeks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My season pass has blackout dated between December 26 and December 31. </li>
  <li>Warm temperatures and rain last week left the hill in less than ideal conditions, so I didn’t go out.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thankfully winter has returned to Stowe, and I’ve been able to hit the slopes again. And with more snow in the forecast I’m hoping to see my day count increase more rapidly in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Oh, and just to be clear my days on the hill are not full days like you would do when on vacation. I still have a <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">job</a> and I have to work. So when I go out for a day in Stowe it’s usually only for an hour and a half to two hours. I might do longer days when snowboarding with Rowan and Melanie, but in general my days on the slope are the equivalent to someone else going to the gym or running or doing some other form of regular exercise.</p>

        <p>Believe it or not, I finally released a new app for iOS. It’s my first new app for <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> in more than 2 years. Somewhere along the way over the last two years I lost my way, but I’m back. </p>

<p>So what’s this new app? It’s <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/big-screen">Big Screen</a>.</p>

<p>Big Screen lets you view the video from your iPhone or iPad’s camera on your TV. It requires an AppleTV, or other AirPlay receiver. Sure, you can use the built-in iOS 7 camera app to do the same, but you will see the app’s chrome on the TV. With Big Screen, there is no chrome or any other evidence that the app is being used. This makes Big Screen ideal for presentation, conferences, and other events where large screen TVs are used to let viewers in the room see the action on the stage.</p>

<p>I got the idea to write an <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/main/big-screen/why">app to display the camera’s video on a TV</a> while attending an event at Rowan’s elementary school. It just goes to show you never know when a new app idea will pop up.</p>

<p>Big Screen is a free app available now in the iOS App Store. <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/main/store/buy/big-screen">Grab a copy</a>, and let me know what you think.</p>
