<h2>About Kirby Turner</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Kirby Turner. I'm an independent software developer and <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">business owner</a> focusing on Mac and iOS programming. I've been programming since the early 1980s. I sell my own <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">apps</a>. I do contract programming when time allows. And I wrote a <a href="http://www.learningipadprogramming.com/">book on iPad programming</a>.</p>

<p>When I'm not sitting behind the keyboard, I can be found hanging out with my wife Melanie and my son Rowan, hiking the mountains of New England, kayaking the waters in and around Stowe, Vermont, and snowboarding down mountains in search of powder.</p>

<p>You can learn more about my professional career over at <a href="http://www.kirbyturner.com/">kirbyturner.com</a>.</p>
