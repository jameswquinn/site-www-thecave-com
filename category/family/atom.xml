    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://photos.thecave.com/Family/Christmas/Christmas-2012/27252258_tNP4bM'><img src='http://photos.thecave.com/Family/Christmas/Christmas-2012/i-cxCnk8n/0/Th/IMG_0911-Th.jpg' class='alignleft' border='0' alt='' /></a> We spent Christmas in Salem this year. Mother Nature was kind and gave us a little snow this morning, but it melted by mid-afternoon. I repeated the tradition I started a few years back by smoking a turkey for dinner. It&#8217;s was delicious, but not has favor packed as it was 2 years ago. I blame it on the lack of thyme. The grocery store was all out when I went shopping.</p>

<p>Rowan got lots of toys. It&#8217;s hard to tell which ones are his favorite since he has played with them all. Melanie got a set of stemless wine glasses, which is something she has wanted for a long time. And they&#8217;re the perfect companion to the wine chiller she got last Christmas. I got a new solar powered keyboard for my Mac, which I&#8217;m using right now to type this postings. And Rowan made me a coffee cup, which will be perfect for my hot cocoa fix.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#8217;s been a good, low key Christmas, just the way we like it.</p>]]></content>
