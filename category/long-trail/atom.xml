    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to weigh every item going with me on my end-to-end hike of the Long Trail. I&#8217;m unfortunately carrying about 5 pounds more than I was hoping, but I remind myself this is a month long hike, not a 3 to 5 day trip. I can do without some gear, such as the Solio charger, on shorter trips.</p>

<p>Here are the final weigh-in numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base pack weight: 24.45 pounds</li>
<li>Fuel: 1.62 pounds</li>
<li>Food: 11.44 pounds</li>
<li>Water: 5.71 pounds</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pack weight: 43.22 pounds</p>

<p>For the more curious, I posted my <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ai_IwjXXrirWdEZrSWh6c3YtR0Q2SmtMaUZRSWQ5cWc#gid=0'>gear list</a> and <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ai_IwjXXrirWdDVCYWozak50SV9DTzdMTGxSenpUbHc#gid=0'>food list</a> on Google Docs.</p>

<p>What would I do differently if I could? Update some gear, specifically my backpack and sleeping bag. Updating these two items could shave off as much as 2 pounds from the base pack weight.</p>

<p>I could also go without the fitbit, Solio charger, iPhone, and cables, but I really want to track my steps, have a way to call someone if an emergency happens, and keep charged up while on the trail. Still, a little weight could be saved by leaving these items at home.</p>

<p>I could also leave the Long Trail Guide book behind, but it might prove useful while out on the trail.</p>

<p>Well, it is what it is, and a base pack weight of 24.45 isn&#8217;t too bad. It&#8217;s not great, but it will do. It is, after all, a month long hike.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://photos.thecave.com/Random/Long-Trail-Thru-Hike-Prep-2012/Packing-Practice/24840367_jkVX9C'><img alt='' src='http://photos.thecave.com/Random/Long-Trail-Thru-Hike-Prep-2012/Packing-Practice/i-9cwLz2t/0/Th/IMG0180-Th.jpg' border='0' class='alignleft' /></a> With only 5 days left before I start my hike, I spent the day packing and unpacking my backpack. To my surprise, every thing fit. But also to my surprise, the unofficial total weight is 45 pounds. This includes food and water. I was hoping my total weight would be 5 to 10 pounds less.</p>

<p>Not much I can do about it now other than to leave some gear behind. I&#8217;m planning to weigh each item on Monday, and will decide what absolutely needs to go and what can stay behind. I doubt, though, I will see much reduction of in weight. Some of my gear, such as my sleeping bag, are in desperate need of an upgrade.</p>

<p>My sleeping bag is 15 years year, and is much heavier than what I would buy today. But a new sleeping bag is not in my future anytime soon. With luck, and a change in our finical situation, I might be able to buy a lighter, better sleeping bag.</p>]]></content>
