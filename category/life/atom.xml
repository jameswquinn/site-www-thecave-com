    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As we flew home from Vancouver I asked Rowan if he thought it was neat that we were flying from a snowboarding vacation to home where we will go snowboarding again. He said he thought it was neat, but I don’t know if he really gets it. I know it blows my mind to think that we live in a place where people come for a vacation to do exactly what we did on our vacation. The difference though is that we get to continue doing what we did on vacation once we return home.</p>

<p>A lot of people go away for a week, maybe two, to ski or snowboard. Or they visit a mountain over the weekend. When they get home they, put their gear away until the next trip. But we get to hit the slopes almost daily. Our gear stays out all winter long.</p>

<p>It’s starting to seem like my life is vacation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While writing my previous post on how <a href="http://www.thecave.com/2015/02/21/working-80-hours-isnt-the-answer/">working 80+ hours is not the answer</a>, I was reminded of a Wall Street startup I interviewed for back in December 1999. The startup was staffed with many brilliant programmers, and I certainly would learn a lot from them. The startup was well funded, and they offered me more money than any other company had offer me. But in the end I turned down their offer.</p>

<p>While walking around the their office, I noticed most of the programmers had sleeping bags under their desks. And every one was sitting in cubes with no natural light. No one had toys on their desks, no pictures of loved ones, and no smiles on their faces. It seemed no one was having fun. </p>

<p>I turned down their offer, and in the end I accepted another offer that paid $45,000 per year less. Why? Because the company I did join had passion, and the people working there shared that passion. We were going to work hard and play hard, and in the end build something great. And we did. </p>

<p>Looking back, I know I made the right decision. Sure, an extra $45,000 would have been nice, but it’s wasn’t worth spending a year in hell.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thecave.com/2015/02/21/working-80-hours-isnt-the-answer/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-21T07:41:24-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2015/02/21/working-80-hours-isnt-the-answer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A founder, or maybe the person is a manager type, asked on Quora, “<a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-you-make-programmers-work-60-80-hours-per-week">How do you make programmers work 60-80 hours per week?</a>” While the question is a pathetic one, the answers that follow, especially the first one, are worth a read. And you should certainly read the answers if you happen to be one of those sad founders/manager types who wants their of programmers to work long hours. In short, if you are trying to force your programmers to work 60, 80 or more hours per week, then you are doing it wrong. </p>

<h2 id="personal-experience">Personal Experience</h2>

<p>I have first hand experience working 80+ hours per week. Heck, there were times I worked more than 100 hours in a single week at one particular startup. There were times when I would go days without going home, choosing instead to sleep in the office for an hour here and an hour there. And if I needed a change of clothes for an important meeting, I would go to the Banana Republic that was below my office to buy a change of clothes instead of going home.</p>

<p>The difference with this experience, however, was that I was never forced to put in those insane hours. No one ever asked me to work 80+ hours. I did it because I truly believed in what we were building. But I also knew what it took to be productive, and that’s why I often times made sure my team did not follow my lead. </p>

<p>I encouraged my team to work no more than 40 hours, and if I noticed someone reaching 50 hours I usually asked that person to take a break, go home, and enjoy life a bit. The work can wait. Sometimes the team member would take my suggestion and leave, other times they would not. But the choice was theirs. I never asked for more than 40 hours per week and in the end we created some amazing things in a short amount of time.</p>

<h2 id="get-to-the-point">Get To The Point</h2>

<p>So what’s my point here? My point is that you can’t force a programmer to work long hours. That person has to want to do it. There has to be a love or passion for what they are doing, otherwise it’s just work. And people max out, especially creative types, after about 32 to 40 hours of work in a single week.</p>

<h2 id="and-now">And Now</h2>

<p>I worked at a few startups putting in 60 or more hours per week, but those days are behind me. Those were fun times with lots of good memories, but I now find it’s more important to break up work with other interest. Today I’m a proponent of what I like to call underworking, or as I more often times jokingly call “being a slacker.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Life’s too short to overwork yourself today in hopes you will have the time later in life for the fun things. Who knows what will happen in the future. You could be hit by a beer truck tomorrow and die. That’s why I believe you should make a point to spend more time <a href="http://www.thecave.com/2014/06/20/enjoy-less-and-love-more/">doing what you love</a> now. The work can wait. </p>

<h2 id="the-long-trail-and-me">The Long Trail And Me</h2>

<p>A couple of years back I did a talk on the topic of underworking at the first <a href="http://www.360intersect.com/">360intersect</a>. In it I talk about my time hiking the Long Trail and the effect it has had on me and the amount of time I spend working each week. Here’s the video for those interested in watching it and learning more about the benefits of working less.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

      <p>Funny how working only 32 to 40 hours a week is thought to be slacking.  <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just spent the last two hours looking through past posts here at thecave. I was writing a lot for the four or five years, and some of those old posts are actually good. But more importantly reading through those old posts gave me a chance to relive my past. </p>

<p>This makes me realize I need to post here more even if the post is short like this one. All too often I’ll post something short to Twitter or Facebook, but I need to start posting it here too. It will be great to re-read my old posts five years from now.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thecave.com/2015/01/18/eliminating-distractions/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-18T13:49:47-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2015/01/18/eliminating-distractions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dan Counsell wrote an excellent post about <a href="http://dancounsell.com/articles/removing-distractions">removing distractions</a>. In the post he talks about how he removed distractions by removing social media apps such as Twitter and Facebook from his iPhone. He’s done other things too such as reading a book instead of checking Twitter, and he started a “No Technology Day” on Saturdays, which is something I think I might start doing as well.</p>

<p>Over the last year I too have been eliminating distractions in my life by spending more of my time <a href="http://www.thecave.com/2014/06/20/enjoy-less-and-love-more/">doing what I love</a> and changing the way I use social networks. Changing the way I use social networks is one of the reasons I wrote my app <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/cross-post">Cross Post</a>. With Cross Post I can share pictures, thoughts, and comments on Facebook, Twitter, and App.net without the worry of being distracted by those sites. Cross Post sends updates to social media sites, but it does not read the time lines or streams from those sites. Cross Post is a tool for making, not reading, micro-blog posts, hence it’s ability to help eliminate distractions. </p>

<p>I did one other thing to help me eliminate distractions. I turned off notifications on all but the most important apps on my iPhone<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Unlike Dan I did not remove the social media apps from my phone. I still want to be able to reply to mentions via my iPhone, which is why I left the apps installed. And in the case of Facebook, it’s the easiest way for me to get news about my family via my sister down in Mississippi, so I still check Facebook once or twice a day. But I do not receive notifications from any of the social media apps on my phone.</p>

<p>So how can you start eliminating distractions in your life. I suggest starting with Dan’s new website, <a href="http://thegreatdisconnect.info">The Great Disconnect</a>. It contains articles, videos and information about how to remove distractions by living a less connected life. Check it out because we all can benefit from being a bit less connected these days.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Examples of app that are important to me and which I still have notifications turned on are ones for my bank and credit cards. I want to make sure I’m alerted if a fraudulent charge is ever made against one of my accounts. Slack is another app that I use with notifications turned on since I use this for work purposes. Beyond that, I have notifications turned off. Oh, and in case you were wondering, I let sites like Twitter notify me of mentions via email, and I only check email a few times a day. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
