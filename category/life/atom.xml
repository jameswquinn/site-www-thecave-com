    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I attended a video cast thingie today - I think the kids call it a webinar - hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/amyhoy">Amy Hoy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alexhillman">Alex Hillman</a> titled <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/procrastination">Kick Procrastination’s Ass</a>. It was really good, especially the first hour. If you have some spare time, I highly recommend watching it.</p>

<p>Some of the keys points for me included:</p>

<h2 id="reasons-for-procrastinating">Reasons for Procrastinating</h2>

<ul>
  <li>(Motivation) Lack of motivation.</li>
  <li>(Destination) Not really defining a specific goal. Too vague in what you want to accomplish.</li>
  <li>(Implementation) Breaking things down into small tasks, but they will be vague if the goals are vague. You need to have structure, a schedule that you stick to to over come this.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-reason-for-procrastinating">Other Reason for Procrastinating</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The more you care about it, the harder it is to do. You are too emotionally involved. For example, it has to be perfect and since you feel like you can’t make it perfect right now, you put it off.</li>
  <li>Get over the fantasy that you are great and your product has to be perfect. Ship it. Make mistakes. And learn.</li>
  <li>Ship early. Example, ship when you only have 5 percent of the features complete. No one will know you didn’t ship the other 95 percent of features. (Note, the 5 percent must still be good and solve pains.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-points-and-thoughts-from-my-notes">Other Points and Thoughts From My Notes</h2>

<p>“If you had to ship today then what choices would you make?”</p>

<p>“You can’t ship a time tracking system without a timer or invoicing.” Sure you can. Once you solve a pain, ship. Other features can be added later. Another example, Early versions of <a href="https://letsfreckle.com">Freckle</a> shipped without a way to change your password. To change your password, you had to email support and have them change it for you.</p>

<p><strong>Think about what can you ship this month? This week? Today?</strong></p>

<p>When do you ship? When you kill one pain. Then kill another pain and ship. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<h2 id="and-one-of-my-favorite-points">And One of My Favorite Points</h2>

<p>Don’t get hung up on the long term destination, think of the short term destination to get it out the door in the near term. Note: You still want to have a long term goals, but don’t let them distract/delay from shipping today</p>

<p>Example: When Alex started <a href="http://www.indyhall.org">Indy Hall</a>, he asked friends if they wanted to meet at the same time and same coffee shop each day. It cost him nothing and that was Indy Hall for the first year. Meeting daily at a coffee shop wasn’t his long term goal, but it was a start. (If you can’t find people to meet at the coffee shop, you’re not going to attract them to your co-working space that you are paying for.)</p>

<p>Check out the video. Good stuff.</p>

    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2015/08/31/you-dont-need-motivation-you-need-good-habits</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amy Hoy answers the question “<a href="https://unicornfree.com/2013/how-do-you-stay-motivated-when-youre-not-making-any-money">How do you stay motivated when you’re not making any money</a>”. The post is a couple of years old, but her answer is as relevant today as it was back then. It’s not about finding and having motivation. It’s about developing good habits.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Amy, you don’t let your kids or pets starve just because you’re not motivated to feed them. You do it anyways. And that exactly what you need to do when starting or running your business, creating a new product, or doing anything that matters to you. You just need to do it even when your not motivated to do it.</p>

<p>I think back to the time when I was writing the first edition of <a href="http://www.learningipadprogramming.com">Learning iPad Programming</a>. I was struggling to stay motivated, and I would go long periods of time (days, weeks, months) without writing a word. I read anything and everything I could find on how to stay motivated, but those tips didn’t help me. </p>

<p>What helped me was structuring my day so that I worked on my book at least an hour each day. I started work on the book at the same time every day, which was 9 am. Some days I only worked on it for an hour, other days I would work on it all day. It depended on how I felt. But I always worked on it for at least one hour starting at 9 am every day even when I wasn’t motivated to work on it.</p>

<p>This structure got me into the habit of writing daily. And after I developed the habit, I found writing became easier for me. And I was able to ship the book. The structure worked so well, I used it again and developed the same habit (and then some<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>) to ship the second edition, which I completed in a fraction of the time compared to the time spent on the first edition.</p>

<p>So don’t let a lack of motivation stop you from getting things done. If you are struggling, then setup a structure that will help you develop the habits you need to get things done.</p>

      <p>Another habit I developed while writing the second edition of my book, and one I still use today, is to listen to my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/kirbyt/playlist/6QUgiw9WPf8qXdgnrdXGvZ">Music to Write To</a> playlist on Spotify.  <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <updated>2015-06-22T11:51:20-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2015/06/22/tips-to-being-more-focused</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tweeted the other day that “I have the problem of wanting to do too many things at once, which is distracting. It’s time for me to learn how to scale back and focus.”</p>

<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/420/18776596119_d03e98a590_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s true. Right now there are a number of things I’m working on and there are even more things that I want to work on. </p>

<p>Lately I’ve been bouncing back and forth between a number of projects, but I haven’t been very productive. I start work on a task but before I finish I let myself get distracted with another task. For instance, I’ll work on a client project and before I finish the task at hand I’ll jump to another task from another project. </p>

<p>I haven’t always worked this way, and I’m not sure why I now struggle to stay focused. It could be the changing of seasons. I had my daily routine dialed in during the winter months, but something has changed recently and it’s not just the seasons. </p>

<p>Maybe my struggle with focus is a sign of being burnt out, maybe it’s the type of projects I’m working on - I’m certainly less excited about certain projects while much more excited about others. Maybe it’s because the kid is out of school and my work day is broken up into smaller chunks than during school time. Or maybe it’s a combination of all of the above. All I know for sure is that I find it difficult to focus, so last week I set out to find new ways to get focused and stay focused<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. And here’s what I came up with…</p>

<h2 id="dont-check-email-first-thing-in-the-morning">Don’t Check Email First Thing In The Morning</h2>

<p>I have stopped checking email first thing in the morning. This is probably one of the hardest habit for me to break, but I’ve come to realize that checking email first thing in the morning leads to the biggest distractions for me. So it is a must change habit for me. </p>

<p>On a typical day I start the morning excited about what I’m planning to do during the day only to have that excitement squashed because of emails. The emails will often times change my plans for the day. Emails, in other words, control my day when I should be controlling my day.</p>

<p>Instead of checking email at the start of the day I now check it later in the morning, usually just before I break for lunch. This gives me a chance to really focus on the work at hand and not let my day get off on the wrong foot.</p>

<p>I admit this hasn’t been the easiest change for me to make. I’ve become accustom to checking my email as soon as I wake up…often times while still in bed. But I recognize that checking email first thing each morning typically controls the rest of my day. It causes me to change the priorities I set the evening before, which in turn makes me feel like I didn’t spend nearly as much time on the most important tasks for the week. That’s why I’ve stopped checking email first thing each day and I have replaced that habit with the next tip.</p>

<h2 id="do-whats-most-important-first">Do What’s Most Important First</h2>

<p>Instead of checking email at the start of my day, I begin my work day by working on the task that is most important for the day. It could be bug fixes for a client’s app, work on a new landing page, writing a blog post, or adding a new feature to one of my apps. I decide the night before what is the most important thing to do and that’s the first task I work on the next morning.</p>

<p>I’ve been following this tip for only a few days, and so far I feel more productive. Plus I feel a greater sense of accomplishment at the end of the day because that task that was most important got the love it deserved.</p>

<p>I highly recommend get into the habit of starting your day by doing the most important task first. If you are writing a book, start your day by writing. If you are working on a client project, and have a upcoming deadline, start your day by working on the project. And remember to work on this important task before you check your email.</p>

<p>Those are the biggest changes I’ve made to my daily routine, and I’m seeing immediate results. But I decided to try a couple of more things to see if I can make more improvements to my focus and productivity.</p>

<h2 id="limit-meetings-to-tuesday-and-thursday">Limit Meetings to Tuesday and Thursday</h2>

<p>My next tip is to limit meetings with others to two specific days each week. For me those two days are Tuesday and Thursday. </p>

<p>The main benefit to doing this is to give me more control over the other days of the week. I can use those other days to focus on productive work without the disruption of meetings. Meetings are, after all, disruptive to a productive day. Nothing kills my productivity faster than having to stop what I’m working on to waste time in a meeting. And yes, most meetings are a waste of time. Even the ones that are not a complete waste of time do waste some time. That casual chit chat at the beginning of the meeting, for example, is unproductive time. So I’m limiting those periods of unproductive time to two days a week.</p>

<p>I get that this isn’t something everyone can do. Heck I’m not 100% sure I can make it happen for me. But if you work for yourself and/or have control over your schedule, then you should be able to make this happen. </p>

<p>Also if you are like me, you already have meetings on your calendar. I, for example, have a recurring client meeting every Monday and Thursday mornings, another client meeting on Monday afternoon, one on Wednesday morning, and just recently a client asked to do a daily stand-up meeting each morning<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. This means there will be a transition period for me as I get my meetings re-scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday. But this is something I’m going to make happen come hell or high water.</p>

<h2 id="pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro Technique</h2>

<p>As if not checking email first thing each morning isn’t already a big change to my daily routine, I’ve decided to give the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com">Pomodoro Technique</a> a try.</p>

<p>The Pomodoro Technique is simple. You set a timer for 25 minutes and during that time you focus on a particular task. When the 25 minutes are up, you take a 5 minute break. Then you start another pomodoro, setting the timer for 25 minutes; focus, focus, focus; then take another 5 minute break. After four pomodoros you take a longer break (15 to 30 minutes).</p>

<p>I’ve heard about the Pomodoro Technique a number of times over the years. I felt the process was not for me, but since focus has become a recent problem for me I decided to give it a try. So far the small blocks of 25-minute work cycles is working well for me given the amount of distractions that can happen throughout the day especially when my wife and kid are home. With the Pomodoro Technique I focus for 25 minutes, then I can use the 5 minute break answer a question my wife might have or see the latest LEGO creation my son has built.</p>

<p>Time will tell if this technique will work for me long term. And I should mention I’m not following the Pomodoro Technique by the book either. There are times when I reach the end of my 25 minute work cycle and I don’t want to stop. So I don’t. I skip my 5 minute break, and I continue working using a new pomodoro. But I do force myself to take a break after the second pomodoro when I combine two of them.</p>

<h2 id="do-these-tips-really-work">Do These Tips Really Work</h2>

<p>So do these tips really work? It’s hard for me to say with absolutely certainty that they work. I’m seeing some positive results already, but only time will tell what works and doesn’t work for me long term. And obviously not every tip will work for every person. Heck, I’m not sure if all the tips will work for me. But these are the tips I’m trying right now, and after only a few days I’m seeing good results. </p>

<p>I’m getting more done faster, and that feeling of being overwhelmed that I got at the end of each day has been replaced with a greater sense of accomplishment and a feeling of being more productive. But the real test for me will be following these tips for a month and see what happens. Trying these tips for a month is the only way I will know what works and doesn’t work for me.</p>

<p>I’ll post an update on my progress in a few weeks. Meanwhile I encourage you to give one, some or all the tips a try to see what works for you. And let me know how it works out for you. </p>

      <p>Yes, I see the irony in that my search for ways to become more focused distracted me from the work that I needed to do last week. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>I personally think daily stand up meetings, like most meetings, are a waste of time, and it’s certainly not a productive use of my time. A daily status email is far more productive in my opinion, and you have the report captured for historical purposes.  <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I played hooky from work afternoon. I should feel guilty but I don’t. </p>

<p>I picked up Rowan from school this afternoon, and we headed to the mountain. Unfortunately I forgot his skis boots, so we had to stop by the house. Then as we tried to get on the lift I realized I left our passes in our jackets. The temperature was in the 60, so we weren’t wearing our jackets. They were still at the house. The afternoon was off to a bad start, but our luck changed. </p>

<p>We were able to get two runs in before the lifts closed thanks to the nice lifties that let us through without our passes. Also we ran into some friends in our first run, including a class mate of Rowan’s. After the lifts shut down for the day we hung out in the parking lot for a bit of après ski with friends. Then we headed to Rimrocks where we ran into more friends. </p>

<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8776/16952950809_f0103c0255_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It was a great father son afternoon with wonderful friends, and when I’m 85 years old I’ll remember how much fun Rowan and I had today. I won’t remember the work I should have done today, and that’s why I don’t feel guilty about how I spent my time this afternoon.</p>

    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2015/03/04/life-is-a-vacation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As we flew home from Vancouver I asked Rowan if he thought it was neat that we were flying from a snowboarding vacation to home where we will go snowboarding again. He said he thought it was neat, but I don’t know if he really gets it. I know it blows my mind to think that we live in a place where people come for a vacation to do exactly what we did on our vacation. The difference though is that we get to continue doing what we did on vacation once we return home.</p>

<p>A lot of people go away for a week, maybe two, to ski or snowboard. Or they visit a mountain over the weekend. When they get home they, put their gear away until the next trip. But we get to hit the slopes almost daily. Our gear stays out all winter long.</p>

<p>It’s starting to seem like my life is vacation.</p>
