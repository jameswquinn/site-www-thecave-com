    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that annoys me most about the size of my iPhone 6 Plus is pulling it out of my pocket while at a bar or restaurant just to see why my phone buzzed. The majority of the time my phone buzzes because of an incoming text message. I have notifications turned off for almost all other apps, and I rarely. if ever, get phone calls these days, which is why I know the buzz is most likely a text message. And if I’m at the bar without my wife, then the person trying to reach me is most likely my wife. </p>

<p>So when the text message comes in, I have to pull out this big honkin’ device out of my pocket and light up the room just to see the message. I may reply, and if I do, it’s a short reply because, after all, I’m busy at the bar. Then I put the phone back into my pocket only to repeat all of this a few minutes later. </p>

<p>Receiving text messages doesn’t annoy me, but having to pull out and put away this big device every few minutes does annoy me. </p>

<p>It occurred to me that one of the possible reasons why Apple decided to release the larger iPhones was because they knew, thanks to the Apple Watch, that there would be no reason to pull out these larger devices from pockets and purses just to check notifications and send simple text messages and replies.</p>

<p>The Apple Watch will make the iPhone 6 Plus size less annoying.</p>

    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2015/03/05/apres-code-a-new-developer-meetup-in-stowe-vt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started organizing developer related meetups in 2001 starting with a weekly happy hour for dev friends and co-workers. Over the years I ended up organizing different types of events, from monthly meetings that included speakers to parties and happy hours to annual snowboarding trips. I even started <a href="http://www.nshappyhour.org">NSHappyHour</a> for Mac and iOS developers, which is still going on each month in Salem, MA.</p>

<p>I realized as I prepared for my move to Stowe, VT, that I was burnt out organizing events and meetups. I stepped down as co-organizer of <a href="http://www.cocoaheadsboston.org">CocoaHeads Boston</a> a few months before my move, which gave me a chance to be just a regular attendee. That’s when I realized I was done organizing events for a while.</p>

<p>After moving to Vermont, I was asked by a few folks if I would start a <a href="http://cocoaheads.org">CocoaHeads</a> chapter in the Burlington area. I said no because I needed a break. The break I needed wasn’t just from being an organizer. I needed a break from attending developer focused gatherings and networking events too. And while it’s been a bit lonely not having local folks to talk shop with on a regular basis, I’ve enjoyed my break. But break time is over.</p>

<p>It’s been nearly two years since I was last responsible for a meetup, but that changes tonight with the first of many Après Code events.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about hosting a developer meetup in Stowe since I moved here, but I wasn’t initially sure there would be enough interest. However, in my short time here I’ve met other software developers living in the area. Some work for companies here in town while others work for shops in and around Burlington. And the number of developers in our small community is growing with companies like <a href="http://corp.inntopia.com/careers/">Inntopia hiring</a> more developers. Even though I knew there were developers living and working in the area, I wasn’t ready to commit to a monthly meetup just yet. </p>

<p>That changed two days before I left for Whistler. I was talking with a local dev friend, Maya Ropelip<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, about writing apps for iOS. During our chat I mentioned my idea for a local meetup. He got excited about the idea and thought the timing was right for hosting a software developer gathering in Stowe. He also agreed to be the co-host in case I need to skip a meetup. So that night I grabbed the domain name, setup a <a href="http://www.apres-code.com/">website</a>, and created a new group on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Apres-Code/">meetup.com</a>. </p>

<p>Starting a new group just 48 hours before I leave the country for a week and a half wasn’t the smartest thing for me to do, but I did it anyways. And now that I’m back home, I’m scrambling to get the word out about tonight’s inaugural Après Code. So without further ado, I’m happy to officially announce <a href="http://www.apres-code.com/">Après Code</a>. </p>

<h1 id="what-is-aprs-code">What Is Après Code</h1>

<p>Après Code is an informal gathering of software developers in Stowe, Vermont. The gathering is a chance for those of us living in and around Stowe, or just visiting the area, to get together to talk about joys of producing software and writing code, seek help or assist others, and most importantly meet and get to know other fine folks in the our community. The group is open to professionals, hobbyists, and anyone with an interest in designing, programming and creating software, apps, and websites.</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>We meet the first Thursday of each month, starting tonight, at 6:30 pm and go until the last person leaves. We’re gathering at <a href="http://rimrocksmountaintavern.com/">Rimrock’s Tavern</a> though this could change in the future. But for now Rimrock’s is the place to be.</p>

<h2 id="more-information">More Information</h2>

<p>You can find more information about the group at the Après Code <a href="http://www.apres-code.com/">website</a>, and you can receive email reminders about future Après Code events by joining the Après Code <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Apres-Code/">meetup.com group</a>.</p>

<p>So if you happen to be in the area, whether you live in the Stowe area or are just visiting, stop by tonight to say hi.</p>

    <updated>2015-02-20T13:17:18-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2015/02/20/for-in-loop-vs-using-block</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brent Simmons talks about <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/02/19/looping_through_objects_in_an_array">for-in loops</a> in a recent post. In it he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>most of the time the for-in enumeration is the straightforward and less clever approach. (“Less clever” is a good thing.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with Brent. I’m a fan of the for-in syntax. It’s straightforward and easy to read. But I have to admit in recent years I’ve been using <code>enumerateObjects​UsingBlock:</code> more often than for-in loops. I’ve been favoring the block syntax because something bbum <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/25646/bbum">said on Stack Overflow</a> a while back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:</code> will be as fast or faster than fast enumeration (<code>for(... in ...</code>) uses the <code>NSFastEnumeration</code> support to implement enumeration). Fast enumeration requires translation from an internal representation to the representation for fast enumeration. There is overhead therein. Block-based enumeration allows the collection class to enumerate contents as quickly as the fastest traversal of the native storage format. Likely irrelevant for arrays, but it can be a huge difference for dictionaries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those who don’t know who <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/25646/bbum">bbum</a> is, he’s Bill Bumgarner. He works at Apple and knows a thing or two about Cocoa. So I believe him when he says “<code>enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:</code> will be as fast or faster than fast enumeration.”</p>

    <link href="http://www.thecave.com/2015/01/18/eliminating-distractions/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-18T13:49:47-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2015/01/18/eliminating-distractions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dan Counsell wrote an excellent post about <a href="http://dancounsell.com/articles/removing-distractions">removing distractions</a>. In the post he talks about how he removed distractions by removing social media apps such as Twitter and Facebook from his iPhone. He’s done other things too such as reading a book instead of checking Twitter, and he started a “No Technology Day” on Saturdays, which is something I think I might start doing as well.</p>

<p>Over the last year I too have been eliminating distractions in my life by spending more of my time <a href="http://www.thecave.com/2014/06/20/enjoy-less-and-love-more/">doing what I love</a> and changing the way I use social networks. Changing the way I use social networks is one of the reasons I wrote my app <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/cross-post">Cross Post</a>. With Cross Post I can share pictures, thoughts, and comments on Facebook, Twitter, and App.net without the worry of being distracted by those sites. Cross Post sends updates to social media sites, but it does not read the time lines or streams from those sites. Cross Post is a tool for making, not reading, micro-blog posts, hence it’s ability to help eliminate distractions. </p>

<p>I did one other thing to help me eliminate distractions. I turned off notifications on all but the most important apps on my iPhone<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Unlike Dan I did not remove the social media apps from my phone. I still want to be able to reply to mentions via my iPhone, which is why I left the apps installed. And in the case of Facebook, it’s the easiest way for me to get news about my family via my sister down in Mississippi, so I still check Facebook once or twice a day. But I do not receive notifications from any of the social media apps on my phone.</p>

<p>So how can you start eliminating distractions in your life. I suggest starting with Dan’s new website, <a href="http://thegreatdisconnect.info">The Great Disconnect</a>. It contains articles, videos and information about how to remove distractions by living a less connected life. Check it out because we all can benefit from being a bit less connected these days.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Examples of app that are important to me and which I still have notifications turned on are ones for my bank and credit cards. I want to make sure I’m alerted if a fraudulent charge is ever made against one of my accounts. Slack is another app that I use with notifications turned on since I use this for work purposes. Beyond that, I have notifications turned off. Oh, and in case you were wondering, I let sites like Twitter notify me of mentions via email, and I only check email a few times a day. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <link href="http://www.thecave.com/2014/10/13/iphone-6-plus-is-too-big-for-me-but-i-bought-it-anyways/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2014/10/13/iphone-6-plus-is-too-big-for-me-but-i-bought-it-anyways</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks back I said I would be buying the <a href="http://www.thecave.com/2014/09/10/iphone-6-plus-pocket-test/">iPhone 6</a>, not the 6 Plus. The 6 Plus is simply too large for me. But I have since changed my mind.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons I changed my mind. First and foremost, I could not justify upgrading from the iPhone 5 to iPhone 6. It’s just a hardware upgrade, and I’m very happy with my iPhone 5. Sure, it would be nice having a device with TouchID but that’s not a must have feature for me. And a better camera would also be nice, but again it’s not totally necessary for me.</p>

<p>I actually started the process of ordering the iPhone 6 on two separate occasions this past week, and each time I stopped before completing the order. There simply weren’t any good reasons for me to upgrade my phone other than to keep the end date for my 2-year contract with Verizon in the month of October. But the same is not true for the iPhone 6 Plus.</p>

<h2 id="different-size-classes">Different Size Classes</h2>

<p>The iPhone 6 Plus has features not available on the 6, features that, as a developer, I need to support in the apps I write. And while I can use the iOS Simulator to test those features, I’m a firm believer that testing on an actual device is far better. Testing on a device gives you a real sense for how your app feels on that device, and that’s why I own a number of iOS devices. The Simulator is great for quick debugging and testings, but nothing beats playing with your app on an actual device.</p>

<p>The iPhone 6 Plus supports different size classes than the iPhone 6 and earlier iPhones. This means, for example, in landscape mode the iPhone 6 Plus can take advantage of displaying a split view controller, which is something the iPhone 6 does not. And again, while I can test this using the Simulator I won’t get a true feel for the differences without using an actual device. But this alone wasn’t the only reason I changed my mind on which device I should buy.</p>

<h2 id="the-pocket-test">The Pocket Test</h2>

<p>Over the weekend, while attending <a href="http://cingleton.com">Çingleton</a>, I did a number of pocket tests using various iPhone 6 Plus devices. Some had cases, others did not. What I found was that while I notice the iPhone 6 Plus in my pocket, it wasn’t as uncomfortable as I thought it would be. Does it feel as nice in my pocket as the iPhone 5 or even the 4s? Certainly not. And there will still be times when I’m annoyed at the size of the 6 Plus when carrying it in my pocket, such as when I’m snowboarding. In fact, I’ll likely have to carry the 6 Plus in my jacket pocket when snowboarding instead of my front pants pocket. And I’m not thrilled about carrying the larger device in a cargo pocket when I’m hiking as it will be banging against my leg as I walk.</p>

<p>But as I thought about it more I realized that I don’t keep my iPhone 5 in my pocket all that much. I work from home and the majority of the time my iPhone is sitting on my desk. I do put it in my pocket when I leave the house, but typically I’m at home more than not.</p>

<p>Still, after a weekend of various pocket tests I wasn’t completely sold on the iPhone 6 Plus. I certainly was leaning towards buying it, but I was still on the fence. That was until I learned about the zoom view.</p>

<h2 id="zoom-view">Zoom View</h2>

<p>With the zoom view an iPhone 6 Plus behaves like an iPhone 6. For instance, when the zoom view is enabled the home screen does not rotate when the iPhone 6 Plus is in landscape mode. In fact, it appears that the size classes used on the iPhone 6 Plus are the same as the iPhone 6 when using zoom mode. This means that the iPhone 6 Plus can be used to test the behavior of your app as if it were running on an iPhone 6. And that sealed the deal for me.</p>

<p>Using the iPhone 6 Plus to test my apps is like having two devices in one. I can test my apps to make sure the user experience is perfect for iPhone 6 Plus users and, thanks to the zoom view, iPhone 6 users. At this point the decision to buy an iPhone 6 Plus became a no brainer for me.</p>

<h2 id="not-a-developer">Not a Developer</h2>

<p>Would I buy an iPhone 6 Plus if I weren’t a developer? Nope, I would not. In fact I would not buy the iPhone 6 either, at least not right now. My iPhone 5 suits me well, and I would have no good reason to upgrade if I weren’t a developer.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-really-want">What I Really Want</h2>

<p>What I really want isn’t the iPhone 6 Plus, but what I want does not exists, at least not yet.</p>

<p>As a developer what I really want is an iPod touch Plus. If Apple were selling an iPod touch Plus that is the same as the iPhone 6 Plus minus the phone, then I would buy it in an instant. That way I could continue using my iPhone 5 as my primary phone device and the iPod touch Plus as a test device. And my son would be happy too because in his mind the iPod touch Plus would be his even though I would use it for testing purposes. But sadly there is no such thing as an iPod touch Plus right now.</p>

<h2 id="change-my-mind-again">Change My Mind Again</h2>

<p>So there you have it…the reasons I changed my mind.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Different size classes and UI behaviors.</li>
  <li>Not as uncomfortable in my pocket as I thought it would be.</li>
  <li>Able to test iPhone 6 and 6 Plus user experience from the same device.</li>
  <li>No iPod touch Plus.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s actually one more reason that led to me changing my mind, Apple’s return policy. If after the first week of owning an iPhone 6 Plus I find that carrying it around in my pocket too annoying then I can return the device. I doubt I will return it especially after talking with many iPhone 6 Plus owners at Çingleton this past weekend, but still, there is always a chance I will change my mind again.</p>
