    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came across one of the silliest benefits I’ve seen for a remote developer job: casual dress code. From the job <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/jobs/1323">posting</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s In It For You</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Medical and dental benefits</li>
    <li>Paid vacation and holidays</li>
    <li>Remote work environment … work where you work best</li>
    <li>Dynamic and dedicated team</li>
    <li>Data/Cell (internet) stipend</li>
    <li>Casual dress code</li>
    <li>Most of all smart and driven team members that love to collaborate, seek feedback, and improve</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure I would want to work for a remote company that has a dress code even if it’s a casual dress code. I like coding in my pjs on many days, which means I would be in violation of the casual dress code. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m having a really bad day today. First, I had to rush to get Rowan to school. He was being his normal slow self, but thankfully we made it there before the bell rang. Then I get to the hill to ride the new snow when I realized I left my snowboard gear at home. So back home I go. But I had to drive behind a plow the entire way home turning a 15 minute drive into a 25 minute drive. And now I have to drive with the stream of traffic back up the hill. </p>

<p>Don’t you just hate days like today.</p>
