<p>My <a href='https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3'>Goruck GR1 backpack</a> arrived today, and so far I&#8217;m very impressed with it. The construction of this bag is top notch, and the bag screams quality. I love the minimalistic look and it&#8217;s low profile. It is a little stiff coming right out of the box, but it&#8217;s already loosening up after packing and unpacking it a few times and wearing it around the house.</p>

<p>I did a test run packing the GR1, loading it with the clothes (jeans, t-shirts, boxers, socks, rain jacket) and gear (iPad, MacBook Pro 15&#8221;, cables, Bose headphones) I plan to take to San Francisco in a couple of weeks. The GR1 had plenty of space for my stuff with room to spare. The true test, of course, comes this weekend when I take it on a camping trip with Rowan.</p>

<p>I have high hopes for this bag. It will be my go to bag for most things I do, from being my main laptop bag to being the bag I take on short trips (7 days or less - I pack light). There is, however, one change I would make to the GR1.</p>

<p>The front, outside pocket is deep enough to hold my iPad, which makes it great especially for air travel. However, the pocket could be about a half inch deeper. There&#8217;s room on the bag to make this happen.</p>

<p>Other than this one change, the bag appears to suit my needs perfectly, and I&#8217;m very excited to put it to the test this summer.</p>
