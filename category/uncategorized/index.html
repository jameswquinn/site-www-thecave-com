        </h2>
        
        <p>I really need to find time to make more blog posting. I definitely have lots to say, opinions to share, tips and tricks learned from some of the programming work I have done over the last few months. But it seems I never have time to write.<br /><br />I’m currently working on new releases for Labor Mate, my <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/labormate">labor contraction stopwatch for the iPhone and iPod touch</a>, and Killink CSV Editor, a <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv">csv editor</a> for the Windows desktop. I’m also working on 3 different custom software development projects for customers and I have another one that will be starting soon. And the new White Peak Software website will be ready very, very soon with new customer support features coming soon. Needless to say, I’m swamped.<br /><br />And of course <a href="http://www.rowanturner.net/">Rowan</a> is only 10 months old and I have to spend as much time as I can with him. Lucky for me I work from home so I get to spend plenty of time with the little guy daily, which is great. But he does interrupt my work from time to time.<br /><br />With luck and some focused time getting some of the projects completed, I’ll be back blogging before you know it. Meanwhile you can <a href="http://twitter.com/kirbyt">follow me</a> over at Twitter.</p>

        </h2>
        
        <p>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> I have received some great feedback [thanks folks!] within minutes of posting my thoughts on <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2008/12/08/framework_or_cms.aspx#comment">using a framework or CMS</a>.  In the post I talk about the two approaches in general terms and I end the post saying I will very liking use a framework for the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> web site refresh.  Everyone who sent me feedback suggested I use a CMS for White Peak but unfortunately I didn’t really say what my requirements are.  Knowing the requirements might change the opinions of some.</p>

            <a href="/2008/12/08/framework-or-cms/">Framework or CMS</a>
        </h2>
        
        <p>I am once again pondering the question of whether to use a framework or CMS for the upcoming refresh the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> web site.  I have gone back and forth on this multiple times over the years and I can never really decide which is better.  And I ask this question often not just for my company web site but for customer web sites that I build.<br /><br />A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework">framework</a> gives me great control and flexibility.  I can design and architect the site to my liking.  I can use the data store of my choice be it XML, a database such as MSSQL or <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>, and I can implement site specific features that meet 100% of the requirements.  But the site eventually reaches a point where the only thing needed is to publish new content.  Create a new landing page for marketing, change copy on an existing page, add a new product page, and so on.  This is when I start thinking “Man, I wish I had a really simple CMS in place.”<br /><br />A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">CMS</a> manages the site content for me.  A CMS really does make publishing new content a snap.  And you get a lot of additional features, or add-ons, with a CMS such as blog engine, forums or discussion groups, user management, calendar, photo gallery…the list goes on.  However, most if not all CMSs are built on top of some core framework (<a href="http://plone.org/">Plone</a> uses <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>, <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a> uses .NET, <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a> uses <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgnitor</a> - I think).  This allows developers to expand and enhance the CMS by writing their own add-ons and extensions.  But to do this the developer needs to know the underlying framework, and if you already know the framework isn’t it sometimes easier and or faster to work directly with the framework bypassing the CMS all together?  Also, it’s been my experience that many of the CMSs out there tend to meet only 80 to 90% of the requirements.  So you get the ease of publishing new content but other areas of the site can be lacking unless, of course, additional code is written to make up for the missing functionality.  It’s a vicious circle.<br /><br />So do you learn and master a framework and have ultimate flexibility or learn and master a CMS and have ease of use for managing content?  And what about rolling your own “simple” CMS.  It can be great experience in the beginning but it will eventually have limitations or even worse become yet another full feature CMS like those already available today.  And if you end up writing your own full featured CMS you have to ask yourself “Would my time have been better spent learning and mastering an existing CMS, its framework and contributing to its community?”<br /><br />Unfortunately I don’t have any solid answers here.  I guess the only real answer to the question should I use a framework or CMS is “It depends.”  It depends on a number of different factors unique to your situation, your needs, your time line, and so on.<br /><br />So what have I decided for the White Peak Software web site refresh?  Honestly I’m still a bit undecided.  The site is currently implemented with ASP.NET and a home grown simple CMS mechanism.  It has worked well for a number of years but I need more functionality on the site.  Building on the current implementation would take too much time so I need a different approach.  My original thought was to use PHP and Zend but then I discovered CodeIgnitor.  CodeIgnitor led me to ExpressEngine and I thought “Ah, the solution for me.  PHP+CodeIgnitor+ExpressEngine”.  But then I started looking at python for general programming tasks and thought “What would it take to use Python programming for web apps?”  Not much I found out so I have decided to use <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.<br /><br />The decision to use Python has lead me to look at a number of different frameworks and CMS solutions.  And while I’m not 100% sure what stack I will select, I’m leaning towards Python + web2py.  <a href="http://www.web2py.com/">web2py</a> is an enterprise ready framework for web based application.  Web development using web2py is very easy and fast, and I really like the development experience on my Mac.<br /><br />I guess it’s safe to assume at this point that I will once again pick a framework over an existing CMS.  What can I say?  I’m a programmer and while the appeal for a CMS is there I still enjoy the flexibility and control I have by doing my own implementation using a framework.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> Here is a <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2008/12/08/framework_or_cms_revisited.aspx">follow up posting</a> that explains my own requirements and why I feel using a framework is better in my situation.</p>

            <a href="/2008/12/01/coderage-iii-not-a-good-start-for-me/">CodeRage III - Not a Good Start for Me</a>
        </h2>
        
        <p>I attended CodeRage I and II. The sessions were insightful and I enjoyed the concept of attending a virtual conference. With the first two CodeRage conferences I had zero problems listening in on and viewing the conferences. But with CodeRage III is only minutes away from starting I can’t say the same thing about attending this latest conference.<br /><br />For starters when you register for the conference you have select the sessions you want to attend. Of course the standard disclaimer appears on the session schedule page “Agenda is subject to change without notice” so I registered for all sessions. This caused a flood of emails to arrive in my Inbox. “Big deal” I thought. I know I registered so I deleted the emails.  Today I learn I needed to save those emails.  Those emails contain the “join now” links for each session.  Unfortunately since I deleted the emails long ago they are now gone forever.  Only solution?  To re-registered for the conference, so that’s just want I did.<br /><br />To re-register I had to use a different email address then the one used in my original registration.  If you use the same email address you get a friendly message saying you have already registered for the event. No s#@t! Since the system already knows I’m registered it would have been nice to see an option that says something like “re-send confirmation emails”. But noooo, so I completed the registration form again this time using a different email address.<br /><br />Now I have re-registered and the confirmation page says “Thank you for registering for this event. You will receive an e-mail that will let you know whether your registration is approved.”  It’s been 30 minutes and still no emails. And the conference has officially kicked off as I type the CodeRage III rant. Luckily someone on Twitter has offered to forward the emails to me. <br /><br />Next issue. CodeRage uses Live Meeting. Live Meeting was a great service a few years back. Heck, I even hosted an online session a time or two back 4 years ago. Problem with Live Meeting is that it only works with Windows. Guess what? Not everyone uses Windows. <br /><br />I switched to the Mac last year and the experience has been so good that I never want to see Windows again. Unfortunately that won’t happen in the real world. For starter I have customers who depend on Windows and I sell products for the Windows desktop. So Windows will remain a part of my life for the unforeseeable future. <br /><br />The solution to using Windows on my Mac is <a href="http://vmware.com/mac">VMware Fusion</a>. This great piece of software allows me to launch instances of Windows in virtual machines on my Mac. This is how I do all my Windows-based development.<br /><br />So what does this have to do with CodeRage III?  I’ll tell you.  Because I use the Windows virtual machines to do programming I typically never configure an audio device. This means no audio will ever play from the Windows-based virtual machines I use. But to attend CodeRage III I need to use Windows.  And since my only access to Windows is through a virtual machine, I now need to re-configure a Windows instance to have an audio device.<br /><br />So to attend CodeRage III I need to have a Windows vm instance with an audio device. I need to install the Live Meeting component.  And I need to re-register or ask someone else to send me the emails with the session links.  Honestly this is just becoming too much trouble.  <br /><br />At this point it has been an hour since I started getting ready for CodeRage III and I’m so annoyed that I just have to move on.  I might try again tomorrow (doubtful) or just want for the replays to be posted in the near future (more likely).  Meanwhile, here are some suggestions for future CodeRage events.&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Use an <a href="http://gotomeeting.com">online conferencing solution that is not tied to Windows only</a>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Send a single email, not one for each registered session&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Provide a web page to registered attendees with links to the sessions&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Don’t expect me to save 20 or so emails (that are flagged as junk anyways)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ol&gt;<br />Hope you are listening CodeGear.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> I decided I want to listening on CodeRage III so I have configured audio in one of my Windows development vm. But now I’m searching though 20 different emails to find the link for today’s current session. This is just plain stupid. Yes I know. If I used Outlook it would have placed an appointment in my calendar but I don’t use Outlook. Big surprise I’m sure.  Too annoyed. Will try again tomorrow when I’m in a better mood.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update 2:</span> It’s been more than 2 hours since I started trying to get my CodeRage on and everything is finally working. Still, the experience has not been very Mac friendly. For instance, here is <a href="http://skitch.com/kirbyt/7fap/ical">what happened</a> when the 20 emails came in.</p>

        </h2>
        
        <p>I feel smart at the moment.  Or maybe “wise” is the better word.<br /><br />I subscribed to the Delphi RAD Studio Professional SA during a special pricing for the pre-order of 2007.  I pay $399 a year (plus or minus a few dollars - I don’t remember the exact amount I pay each year).  I noticed the upgrade from 2007 to 2009 costs $624.  Assuming CodeGear continues the trend started in 2007 I should save more bones over time and stay current.  I like it when I feel like I have a good deal.<br /><br />Have you read about the new managed code version of Delphi called Prism?  It’s actually not new.  It’s RemObject’s Oxygen compiler for Visual Studio.  I’m actually looking forward to playing with this.  I was always interested in RemObject’s Chrome (renamed to Oxygen earlier this year) but didn’t want to spend the money.  But since it is included as part of RAD Studio I get it for no additional cost.<br /><br />Doubt I’ll ever really use it.  I don’t see converting my <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv.aspx">csv file editor</a> to manage code and I doubt customers are not going to ask me to write their .NET apps in Object Pascal, though I do prefer Delphi programming over C#.  Also, I’m moving my personal web sites to python, my new favorite scripting / programming language.  [Side note: I’m starting to do more and more with python.  Mostly prototyping algorithms but I do have one program that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/">downloads daily sales reports for iPhone developers</a> hosted at Google Code.  The program has been picked up and included in another open source project.  It’s been fun to do.]<br /><br />So I’m excited to play with Prism but honestly it’s about 2 years too late for CodeGear in my opinion.  At least 2 years too late for me.  And even though RemObject’s Chrome was available 2 years ago I didn’t see spending the additional money on it at that time.  Still, I might use it to play with SilverLight.  Unlike CodeGear/Borland’s past .NET attempts, Prism fully supports the latest .NET frameworks, libraries, and technologies coming out of Redmond.  Oh, and Mono too.  Though right now I will probably use python if I need to write something cross platform.</p>

        </h2>
        
        <p>Apple publishes daily sales figures on their iTunes Connect website for software vendors who have applications for sale in the iPhone App Store.  I’ve been making a point to download the daily file each morning but I know I cannot continue doing this manually.  What I need is an automated way to download the daily file.<br /><br />I searched the net for script code that will download the iTunes Connect daily sales report but I came up empty.  So I decided to write my own.<br /><br />I’ve been interested in getting into Python programming and I thought what better way to learn Python programming than to write a script that will download the daily sales report from the iTunes Connect website.  It turned out to be a fairly easy task to complete using Python.  Guess it goes to show how powerful Python really is.<br /><br />So here is my very first Python script.  I’m sure there are things I could do better in the script, but hey, it’s my first script.  Enjoy.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">UPDATE:</span> The original code had a problem with retaining cookies set by the iTunes Connect website.

        </h2>
        
        <p>It was announced yesterday that <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/">Embarcadero</a> will acquire <a href="http://www.codegear.com/">CodeGear</a> from <a href="http://www.borland.com/">Borland</a>.  Details about the announcement are already over the net, <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/nickhodges/2008/05/07/39058">here</a>, <a href="http://metafrequency.blogspot.com/2008/05/embarcadero-and-codegear.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/abauer/2008/05/07/38860">here</a> for starters, so I will not recap the details.<br /><br />I have been saying for a long time that CodeGear needs to separate from Borland, and now it is finally going to happen.  I’m excited to see what will happen next.  Embarcadero seems like a fine suitor for CodeGear.  I just hope small software companies, aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_ISV">microISV</a>, without a focus on databases, such as <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>, are not forgotten about.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> Michael Swindell of CodeGear says <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/michaelswindell/2008/05/09/34745">CodeGear will still be the go to company ISV and microISV</a>. This is good to hear.</p>

        </h2>
        
        <p>Last week Comcast was running a free preview of MLB Extra Innings.  My wife and I both really liked being able to view games outside of our local marketing area, and since we will not be able to attend as many baseball games this year compared to past years we decided to subscribe to the service.  I noticed at the bottom of the television screen the cost for MLB Extra Innings was only $159.  A little high in my opinion but we would spend that much attending 1 game at Fenway.<br /><br />I called Comcast to subscribe and to my surprise the $159 price was a sales price available only during the preview.  The regular price is $199 and that was the price they wanted to charge me when I called.  I explained that I saw the $159 price during the preview, but all the nice lady could say was “The codes are no longer in the system.”  Well, for $40 more dollars I decided <b>not</b> to subscribe to the MLB Extra Innings service.  Instead of taking the $40 off, signing up a new subscriber, and making $159 from me, Comcast and MLB Extra Innings will now gets $0 from me because I refuse to pay the higher price.<br /><br />Comcast will survive without my $159 but it is really poor customer service.  Not only that, MLB Extra Innings loses out on an additional subscriber.  And who knows.  My wife and I might have enjoyed the service so much that we subscribe again next year.  Instead Comcast and MLB Extra Innings will get nothing extra from us and all because of $40.</p>

            <a href="/2008/03/05/a-better-way-to-buy-music/">A Better Way To Buy Music</a>
        </h2>
        
        <p>Nine Inch Nails quietly released their latest album, <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/">Ghost I-IV</a>, online Sunday night but it was anything but quiet.  Fans flooded the server to get the new album.  This caused an overload on the server, which finally was brought down on Monday for a few hours to correct the problems.  Despite the temporary server problems in the first 24 hours, this experiment in how to buy and sale music online is a complete success in my opinion and I hope more artists follow NIN’s lead.<br /><br />NIN is offering a free sampling of the new album, Ghost I, which includes the first 9 songs.  You can buy the complete 36-song album, Ghost I-IV, for only $5, which I did right away.  A great bargain in my opinion.  Other purchase options include a 2-CD set for $10, deluxe packaging for $75, and a limited signed edition, which sold out in less than 24 hours, for $300 (2500 limited edition units x $300 = $750,000 gross revenue in 24 hours…awesome!).<br /><br />Years ago I collected music, first on vinyl than on CD.  My total music collection was around 3,000 pieces but a third of those pieces were stolen when I moved to NYC.  This depressed me and I was no longer motivated to buy new music.  I went from buying hundreds of CDs a year to buying less than 5.  And this lack of motivation has nothing to do with pirated music available on the Internet.  My MP3 library is a copy of my favorite music from my CD collection, not pirated music.  So over the past 8 years I have not listened to or bought much in the way of new music.  But this is slowly changing.<br /><br />Recently I bought a couple of albums from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mp3">Amazon MP3 Download store</a>.  Why now?  Because Amazon offers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a>-free music.  Buying music online is nothing new but I have a real problem with DRM enabled music that limited my personal use.  So the introduction of DRM-free music was the first step in getting me to buy new music, but I’m still not buying as much music as I use to.  Why?<br /><br />I prefer buying complete albums.  Sure, I have a favorite song here and there, but to me the entire album represents the complete vision the artist had at that time.  I can’t image buying and listening to only 1 track from <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:39foxqt5ldke">Lou Reed’s New York</a>.  You really must listen to the entire album, and in song order not shuffled.  Again, in my opinion.  But buying complete albums even on Amazon MP3 Download store can be expensive especially for some of the music I like.  For example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Eye/dp/B000UTTFF2/ref=sr_f3_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1204725628&amp;sr=103-1">The Eye</a> by <a href="http://www.yello.com/">Yello</a> is $19.80 on Amazon MP3 and that’s only $2 less than what I paid for the CD when it first came out.  <br /><br />So the high cost of digital music downloads keeps me from buying as much music as I once did.  Why pay CD price for something that is digital only?  The lack of packaging and materials alone should sufficiently lower the price for a complete album.<br /><br />So while I’m still slow to buy music like I once did, but that will likely change if more artist follow the lead of Trent Reznor and NIN.  $5 is a great price for a digitally downloaded album, a price I’m willing to pay over and over again.  And it is probably a good price for the artist too who, like NIN did with Ghost I-IV, publishes and sells the album directly to the consumer bypassing the record industry.  I don’t know the actual figures but I got to believe a $5 album sold as digital download directly by the artist will put more money in the artist’s pocket than selling same album for $14 on CD though a record company.</p>
