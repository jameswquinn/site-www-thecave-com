[![][thumbnail]][gallery] I refuse to accept that winter is over. For instance, today I hiked up Mt. Mansfields to do a snowboard run on Nosedive. And based on the crowd, I wasn't the only one who thought today was a good day for a hike.

I posted some pictures from today's hike for your viewing pleasure.
