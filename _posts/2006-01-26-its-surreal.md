My wife and I have actually moved from New York City to <a href="http://www.salemweb.com/">Salem, Massachusetts</a>.  It's still a bit surreal for us.  As we were driving out of the city yesterday, it didn't feel like we were really leaving.  It felt more like we were making a quick trip and will be returning in a few days.  I think it will hit me in a few days that we're not returning to the city to live.  Then again it might take longer for that to happen since I will be returning to New York next week for a meeting.<br /><br />The move was the smoothest and easiest move I have ever made.  The movers from <a href="http://www.ozmoving.com/">Oz Moving</a> were outstanding.  I highly recommend using Oz.<br /><br />The only problem that occurred yesterday was a flat tire in Connecticut.  The moving truck got a flat on I-95 which delayed their arrival into Salem.  But they did arrive.  We got everything unloaded, and now all that awaits us is the process of unpacking.
