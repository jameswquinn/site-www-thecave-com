Last year I kept a <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/01/26/my_trips_in_2007.aspx">travel log</a> to see how much I really travel in 1 year.  It was interesting to see that I do too much travel and explains why it seems like I'm always on the go.  While I do not plan to travel nearly as much this year - actually my wife and I recently realized nearly 6 months will past between airplane travel for us, something that has not happened for me since 1997.  I'm usually on an airplane at least once a month.<br /><br />So 2008 will not be as travel heavy as previous years but I still want to track my trips for the year.  So here is where I have been so far in 2008:<ol><br /><li>January 16: New York City (business)</li><br /><li>January 29 - January 30: Killington VT</li><br /><li>February 14 - February 17: Killington VT</li><br /><li>February 24 - February 25: Portland ME</li><br /><li>May 23 - May 25: East Durham NY (Irish Festival)</li><br /><li>June 2 - June 10: Southern France (Aix en Provence and Nice)</li><br /><li>June 20 - June 23: Camp Turner (Village Creek State Park, Arkansas)</li><br /><li>June 27 - June 29: Loudon NH (NASCAR weekend)</li><br /><li>July 5 - July 12: Lake Champlain VT</li><br /><li>July 25 - July 28: Memphis TN</li><br /><li>August 3: New York City (Yankees Game - they won!)</li><br /><li>September 5 - September 7: Lake George, NY (Camp Murphy)</li><br /><li>September 24 - September 29: Bryn Athyns, PA (Laura and Jason's wedding)</li><br /></ol>
