        <h2><a href="/2005/06/10/the-power-of-auto-responders/" rel="bookmark" title="The Power of Auto-Responders">The Power of Auto-Responders</a></h2>

        <p>I purchased a pricy set of components today, or at least I tried. The browser window timed out during the final processing of the order. The problem is I do not know if the order went through or not.<br /><br />I sent an email to the company&#8217;s support and sales addresses but I haven&#8217;t heard anything back yet. I find this very annoying. At a minimum I would expect an auto-responder that sends a return email saying something like &#8220;We value you business. We will respond to your request as soon as possible.&#8221; It&#8217;s been 40 minutes now with no response. Obviously the vendor does not use an auto-responder. <br /><br />An auto-responder is a simple use of technology that I believe all companies selling products on the Internet should use. Heck my own company, <a href='http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/'>White Peak Software</a>, has the capability enabled to provide immediate response to client requests. It amazes me that a successful component vendor who has been in business for years does provide the simplest of services to its customers.<br /><br />All is not lost though. I have learned a valuable lesson from the experience. <br /><br />1) Auto-responders can be very powerful and provide assurance to customers. <br />2) Vendors should provide detailed information about what to expect from an online ordering experience.<br /><br />This second point is very important to me as I prepare to start selling products. I definitely plan to publish a web page that explains the order process to customers. This will tell my customers what to expect and what to do should something go wrong.</p>

        <p>I am preparing the first beta release of a new application that is used for diagnosing problems with SMTP. The program allows the user to test account settings against an SMTP server by sending a test message.<br /><br />I have been testing the program from various locations including the hotel here in Atlanta. I was surprised to see that the network here redirects SMTP requests to its own SMTP server which relays the message to the appropriate destination. No wonder laptop users have problems with email. The experience behind the scenes can be different based on the network and the user may never know.<br /><br /><a href='/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticsnapshot01.JPG'><img border='0' height='331' src='/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticsnapshot01.JPG' width='380' /></a><br />Click image to enlarge.</p>

        <p>Over the past few months I have come across various blog <a href='http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1800'>posting</a> where a developer will say something like &#8220;I can&#8217;t see myself as a developer in 20 years&#8221; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t see myself writing code until I retire.&#8221; I on the other hand can&#8217;t imagine a time when I will not want to write code and develop software. I&#8217;ve done this for 20+ years and I&#8217;m hoping for another 20+ years.<br /><br />Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m not saying I want to sit behind the keyboard every day for the rest of my life. After all, I still enjoy my time riding snow covered slopes. But I do see myself writing code well into my retirement years. For me the trick is keeping the work exciting and fresh.<br /><br />When I start getting bored I find new ways to liven things up. For instance, over the years I have switched languages a number of times. I was a BASIC/PASCAL developer in the 80&#8217;s then I switched to C/C++. A few years later I switched to VB followed by Delphi followed by Java. ASP and a return to VB followed which was later replaced with C# and the .NET Framework. And today I am writing Win32 code using Delphi.<br /><br />Other ways to make software development fresh again is to pursue new areas of interest. Instead of writing yet another web-based application, find a project that allows you to write a desktop application. If you have been doing in-house development for years consider a move to an ISV. I personally find commercial software development is a different experience and worlds apart from enterprise, in-house development.<br /><br />Other ways to keep software development fresh that have worked for me:<ul><li>Participate on a standard committee - help change the industry</li><li>Spend the next year focused on a particular technology that is new to you</li><li>Work with a new team and participate in a role that is new you - for instance become the QA manager if you have been a senior developer for the last few years</li><li>Write your own software...and sell it!</li></ul></p>

        <p>On Friday I was working remotely in the Philadelphia area. This is one of the freedoms of my job that I enjoy&#8230;working from anywhere in the world. However, working from another office or even someone else&#8217;s home is not quite the same as working from my office.<br /><br />While many people these days have broadband Internet access through cable modems and DSL, not everyone has a wireless access point. So I tend to be confined to a single room when I need Internet access. Friday was one of those days. <br /><br />I worked in one room which has more comfortable seating but was disconnected from the Internet. When I needed an Internet connection, I would move to the room with the cable modem and hub. By the end of the day I was becoming frustrated moving between rooms. But I solved the problem by the end of the day.<br /><br /><img align='right' border='0' src='http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/airportexpressinhand.jpg' /><br />I headed to BestBuy and bought an <a href='http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/'>AirPort Express</a>. Designed to allow users to play music wirelessly from iTunes to their stereos, it also acts as a wireless USB print server and a wireless access point. But what really makes this a great device is the size. The device is very small and has no bulky power supply or cables. All you need to setup the wireless access point is a patch cable, which I already carry for me on road trip.<br /><br />Whether I am in a hotel that only offers wired Internet access or a friend&#8217;s house with a broadband connection, I can now be guaranteed wireless access.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2005/05/27/xmlserialization-patent/" rel="bookmark" title="XmlSerialization Patent">XmlSerialization Patent</a></h2>

        <p>Early this week Microsoft was granted a <a href='http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,898,604.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/6,898,604&amp;RS=PN/6,898,604'>patent</a> on their approach to serializing an object to XML. While I can see how XmlSerialization provided by the .NET Framework is unique, I have mixed emotions about the patent. For instance, XmlSerialization is probably my number one favorite feature in the .NET Framework. I find I use it all the time. But I now also spend a lot of development time in Delphi writing a Win32 application and I have thought about ways to implement a similar Xml serialization feature based on RTTI. <br /><br />My concern with such a patent is that it might discourage other developers from inventing a form of Xml serialization for a different environment such as Delphi that is as flexible and easy-to-use as .NET XmlSerialization. Put another way, if Borland decided to implement a way to store metadata about a class structure for a Win32 target and a developer used this metadata to provide a mechanism to map the object shape into an Xml schema as defined by the metadata and serialize the object into an Xml document based on that schema, would that be a violation of Microsoft&#8217;s XmlSerialization Patent?<br /><br />Also, how does such a patent effect open source efforts such as Mono? If someday Mono is widely adapted will Microsoft want to charge developers for the use of XmlSerialization in applications using the Mono framework?<br /><br />I don&#8217;t know the answers to my questions, and as I said I have mixed emotions about the patent. On one hand, I see how it is a unique technique for serializing objects to Xml. On the other hand, I fear it will limit or completely eliminate a similar approach in other development environments.</p>

        <p>I took the &#8220;What Video Game Charater am I?&#8221; quiz and it said I am a Light Cycle, which is cool since I really like the movie Tron. However it also said that if I am not a Light Cycle then I&#8217;m an Asteroid. This is also also cool to me. I remember staying at my cousin&#8217;s house once and playing a single game of asteriods for 18 hours straight. We took shifts to keep the game going.<br /><br />So which am I, a Light Cycle or an Asteroid?<br /><br /><table border='0'><tr><td><br /><a href='http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl'><img align='LEFT' alt='What Video Game Character Are You?
