I had to stop after 13 days due to a knee injury. As I said in a tweet, “Th-Th-Th-Th-Th…That’s all, folks. I’m not continuing the hike due to constant pain that has zapped all the fun out of the journey.” I’m disappointed that I wasn’t able to hike the trail end to end, but I’m glad I at least tried it. And I will be back next year to complete the remaining 182 miles.</p>

<h1 id='an_amazing_experience'>An Amazing Experience</h1>

<p>Despite not finishing and having to deal with knee pain for weeks that followed leaving the trail, I still look back to my days on the trail and think to myself, “What an amazing experience.” Leaving the trail was a hard thing to do. I struggled with mixed emotions. My heart was into the hike and I wanted to continue. But my brain, and the pain, said it was time to stop. Even after I decided I would not continue the hike, I would stare out at the mountains and daydream about being on the trail. Even now, weeks later, when I see a tree covered mountain I think to myself how great it would be hiking up and over the summit. But a thru hike wasn’t meant to be for me this year.</p>

<h1 id='whats_next'>What’s Next</h1>

<p>This is not it for me and the Long Trail though. I’m planning to complete my hike next year, and I hope to re-attempt a thru hike again the following year. Also, I want to write up a blog post about my experience hiking the first 90 miles of the Long Trail from the Canadian border to Jonesville, Vermont. I hope to do this within the next week or so, but I also need to finish writing the second edition of my iPad book. Time will tell if I actually write the blog post. Meanwhile, enjoy the <a href='http://photos.thecave.com/Trips/Hikes/Long-Trail-Thru-Hike-2012/25322189_WRGQQ7'>pictures</a> I took during my journey.</p>]]></content>

    <id>http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2012/08/21/weighing-in</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to weigh every item going with me on my end-to-end hike of the Long Trail. I&#8217;m unfortunately carrying about 5 pounds more than I was hoping, but I remind myself this is a month long hike, not a 3 to 5 day trip. I can do without some gear, such as the Solio charger, on shorter trips.</p>

<p>Here are the final weigh-in numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base pack weight: 24.45 pounds</li>
<li>Fuel: 1.62 pounds</li>
<li>Food: 11.44 pounds</li>
<li>Water: 5.71 pounds</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pack weight: 43.22 pounds</p>

<p>For the more curious, I posted my <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ai_IwjXXrirWdEZrSWh6c3YtR0Q2SmtMaUZRSWQ5cWc#gid=0'>gear list</a> and <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ai_IwjXXrirWdDVCYWozak50SV9DTzdMTGxSenpUbHc#gid=0'>food list</a> on Google Docs.</p>

<p>What would I do differently if I could? Update some gear, specifically my backpack and sleeping bag. Updating these two items could shave off as much as 2 pounds from the base pack weight.</p>

<p>I could also go without the fitbit, Solio charger, iPhone, and cables, but I really want to track my steps, have a way to call someone if an emergency happens, and keep charged up while on the trail. Still, a little weight could be saved by leaving these items at home.</p>

<p>I could also leave the Long Trail Guide book behind, but it might prove useful while out on the trail.</p>

<p>Well, it is what it is, and a base pack weight of 24.45 isn&#8217;t too bad. It&#8217;s not great, but it will do. It is, after all, a month long hike.</p>]]></content>

To my surprise, every thing fit. But also to my surprise, the unofficial total weight is 45 pounds. This includes food and water. I was hoping my total weight would be 5 to 10 pounds less.</p>

<p>Not much I can do about it now other than to leave some gear behind. I&#8217;m planning to weigh each item on Monday, and will decide what absolutely needs to go and what can stay behind. I doubt, though, I will see much reduction of in weight. Some of my gear, such as my sleeping bag, are in desperate need of an upgrade.</p>

<p>My sleeping bag is 15 years year, and is much heavier than what I would buy today. But a new sleeping bag is not in my future anytime soon. With luck, and a change in our finical situation, I might be able to buy a lighter, better sleeping bag.</p>]]></content>

    <updated>2012-08-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2012/08/16/planning-to-thru-hike-the-long-trail</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One week from today, on August 23, I start a month long journey to hike the <a href='http://www.greenmountainclub.org/page.php?id=2'>Long Trail</a> from end to end. I plan to start at the Vermont-Canadian border, and hike south to North Adams, Massachusetts. I’m not exactly sure how long the hike will take me, but it should be somewhere between 25 and 35 days depending on my daily mood, how much or little I hike each day, and so on.</p><p>The <a href='http://www.greenmountainclub.org/page.php?id=2'>Long Trail</a> is the oldest long distance hiking trail in the U.S., and it was the inspiration for the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail'>Appalachian Trail</a>. The Long Trail spans 272 miles from border to border as it follows the main ridge of the Green Mountains. And it crosses Vermont’s highest peaks, providing some beautiful views. </p><h2 id='whydothis'>Why Do This?</h2><p>You may be asking yourself, why am I doing this? The answer is simple. Because I can. </p><p>Most people today are so wrapped up with work and life that taking a month off to backpack is but a dream. And many of those lucky few who can take the time off do so in their early adult life, before or after college, before kids, and before life’s burdens take hold. But for me - in my mid&#8211;40s, with a wife and a kid, running my own indie software shop - I’m lucky to have a very understanding wife and a structure to my life that makes it possible for me to do a trip like this. That said, now is still not a good time for me to take this hike. </p><p>I’m working on the second edition of my book, I need to focus on a new app that I’m writing, and product sales are still down after focusing so much attention on writing the first edition of my book last year. In other words, we’re broke and taking time off isn’t going to help matters. If anything, it will only make things worse from a financial point of view. But like planning to start a family, it seems there is never a good time to do an adventure like this. So why should I wait?</p><p>Another reason I’m doing this is because it’s something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. When I was a teenager, I dreamt of riding my bike across Tennessee, from Memphis to Kingsport. I had the bike. I bought maps, planned the route, and started collecting gear such as a small, light single-person tent. There was even a brief time when my mom entertained the thought of joining me, which would have been outstanding at the time. But alas, the bike trip never happened. I chickened out.</p><p>While hiking the Long Trail end to end is not the same as riding my bike across Tennessee, it’s still in the same spirit; the spirit of going on an adventure. For some, the adventure is backpacking across Europe like my wife did during her college years - though she didn’t sleep on the ground for 30 days nor did she have to carry all her food on her back. Still, it was the spirit of adventure, and that’s one of the reasons I’m doing this; to have the adventure I didn’t do when I was younger.</p><p>There’s another reason I’m doing this: the challenge. This is the number one reason I’m doing this. To see if I can conquer the challenge.</p><p>I live in a connected world. Email, Twitter, the Internet, are all very important aspects to my daily life and work. Disconnecting for a few days it great, but I start to stress out after being disconnected for more than 4 or 5 days. So disconnecting for a month is going to be challenging for me.</p><p>There is also the challenge of being self-supported on this adventure. I’m not planning to mail drop supplies and food. Instead, I will hike into towns once a week to buy supplies and food, 5 to 7 days worth each time. The food is probably one of the biggest challenges for me on this trip, and it’s definitely in my Top 2 Biggest Worries.</p><p>No, I will not starve, though there might be times when I feel very hungry. I’m a picky eater, and I honestly don’t know what to expect once I eat through my first week’s worth of food. Will I be able to buy foods I like that are also suitable for the trail? I’ll find out soon enough.</p><p>I also don’t know how much food I really need. I have an idea of the amount I need for 5 to 7 days, but is that amount accurate when I’m burning 4,000 to 5,000 calories at day? This is something I will only learn from experience, and I can only get the experience by doing it. So while food is one of my biggest worry, it’s not going to stop me from doing this adventure.</p><p>What will stop me, however, could be me. Can I handle this trip mentally? And that’s my other biggest worry about thru hiking the Long Trail. The hike represents a physical challenge, but I believe the mental challenge is far greater than the physical challenge.</p><p>I’ve read lots of books on long distance hiking, mostly about the Appalachian Trail. A majority of the people attempting to thru hike the AT don’t make it, and a majority of those folks give up within the first 7 days. While the LT is not the AT - they do share the same trail system for a span through southern Vermont - those first 7 days will be the same mentally.</p><p>Will I make it for more than 7 days on the trail? Will I make it 14 days, 21 days, even more? I think about this more and more as my start date draws closer. Will I enjoy the solitude, the wilderness, sleeping on the ground each night, being outside 24&#8211;7 through heat, cold, sun, and rain? Will it still be fun after eating yet another mug of Mac-and-Cheese for the N-th day in a row? And what effects will the physical demands of the hike put on my mental psyche?</p><p>Despite my worries, family and friends have been very supportive, saying things like, “You’ll do it. You’ll finish the hike.” But you really don’t know what will happen until you try. It’s a month of no family, no code slinging, no Internet, no email, and no creature comforts. I would be fooling myself if I didn’t think there is a mental challenge to hiking the Long Trail end to end, or doing any long distance hike for that matter. That said, I’m committed to making it to the end, but I really won’t know if I can make it to the end until I try.</p><h2 id='qa'>Q&amp;A</h2><p>People have been asking me all sorts of questions about this trip, and I’m sure others will have similar questions upon learning about my crazy idea of thru hiking the Long Trail. Here are some of the more common questions and answers.</p><p><strong>What do you do about food?</strong> I pack the food and carry it on my backpack. I have a bear canister that holds 5 to 7 days worth of food. I prefer using the bear canister over hanging my food each night. With the bear canister, I just place it on the ground 200 feet or more from my camp site. This is so much easier than finding a tall tree and hanging my food. Plus, my bear canister doubles as stool for when I need to sit.</p><p><strong>What will you eat?</strong> I need to consume calories and lots of them, so I plan to eat a lot of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, though I’ll likely only eat this at dinner time to save on fuel for my stove. I also have other packaged rice and pasta dishes for dinner like the ones from Knox. They cook quickly, and I’ll be able to save on fuel by using my <a href='http://www.thecave.com/2012/08/10/test-run-on-my-dyi-pot-cozy/'>pot cozy</a>.</p><p>Breakfast, lunch, and snacks will be a combination of junk foods, peanut butter sandwiches, beef jerky, and trail mix. I’m still not exactly sure how to do the peanut button sandwiches yet, but I have a few more days to figure that out.</p><p><strong>What do you do when it rains?</strong> I get wet. I’ve hiked in the rain before, and I’ll be hiking in the rain on this trip. I have a rain cover for my backpack, and I will keep my extra clothes in a dry bag to ensure I have something dry to sleep in each night. And of course my tent has a rain fly. So while some days I will get wet on the hike, I do plan on being (mostly) dry when I sleep.</p><p><strong>How much will you hike each day?</strong> That’s depends on a number of things. Ideally, I should average about 10 to 12 miles a day to finish the hike in my allotted 35-day max time frame. Realistically, I’ll likely start the hike doing around 10 to 12 miles a day then gradually upping that number to 15, 20, maybe more miles per day. But my goal is 10 to 12 miles a day on average.</p><p><strong>Will you hike every day?</strong> Most likely, yes. Though I can see myself deciding to take a day off here and there depending on weather, tiredness, etc.</p><p><strong>How are you going to get food?</strong> I plan to hike into various towns at least one a week to get supplies and food. This means that while the Long Trail is 272 miles through Vermont, I’ll actually be hiking more miles. I estimate I will hike somewhere around 320 miles total by the time I make it to North Adams, Massachusetts.</p><h2 id='keepingintouch'>Keeping in Touch</h2><p>I should also mention that while I will be disconnect from the world during the hike - meaning I will not be checking text messages, voice mails, emails, Twitter mentions, and so on - I do plan to do a daily, or almost daily, tweet to let family and friends know what’s going on. You can follow me, <a href='http://www.twitter.com/kirbyt'>@kirbyt</a>, on Twitter if you want to read my updates during the hike.</p><p>I’ve debated long and hard about whether I should or should not do the daily tweet. I decided to try it, though I’m doing it using <a href='http://support.twitter.com/articles/14020-twitter-sms-commands'>Twitter’s SMS feature</a>. This will help save battery life on my iPhone, and reduce the temptations to read my Twitter stream.</p><p>So now you know where I will be should you try to reach me between August 23 and the end of September.</p>]]></content>

<p>The other day I mentioned I made a <a href='http://thecave.com/2012/07/30/dyi-pot-cozy/'>pot cozy for my cooking mug</a>. Today I decided to test it by cooking up a box of Kraft Macaroni &#38; Cheese. I&#8217;m happy to report the test was a success.</p>

<p>I brought 2 cups of water to a slight boil, poured the hot water into the ziplock freezer bag containing the macaroni, and then I closed the bag. I placed the bag into the cooking mug, and I placed the mug into the cozy. I put on the cozy top, and about 15 minutes later the macaroni was ready (though I may only wait 10 minutes next time). I mixed the cheese, and was ready to eat.</p>

<p>There was one unexpected surprise with using the pot cozy. I ate the Mac and Cheese directly from the bag, which was in the mug that was in the cozy. I was able to eat the very hot Mac and Cheese without having to hold a hot bag. The cozy kept the Mac and Cheese hot while I comfortably held the meal without fear of burning my hands.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now looking forward to using the pot cozy on the trail in a couple of weeks where I plan to try cooking other hot meals.</p>

<p>Rowan has gone to at least one Yankee game a year at Yankee Stadium since he was born in March 2008. The only year he missed was 2009 when the new stadium opened. And yes, he attended a game - though he slept through most of it - at the old Yankee Stadium.</p>

<p>This year we watched the Yankees win over the Seattle Mariners. Rowan enjoyed the game, but not as much as past years. He thought the game was too long, and he was ready to leave by the seventh inning. But like a real trooper, he stayed and let Melanie and I enjoy the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The only bad part of the day was the return trip home. Bad storms were moving in throughout New York City all the way up to Boston. This caused a number of flights from LGA to Boston to cancel. Lucky for us, Melanie met another passenger who was non-reving and had rented a car. She offer to let us hitch a ride up to Boston, and we of course accepted her offer. We got home later than planned, but thanks to Jane we got home.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m preparing to take a long distance hike in a few weeks (more details on that coming soon), so I&#8217;ve been researching different ways to reduce the amount of fuel I need for cooking. I came around this neat posting that explains <a href='http://blackwoodspress.com/blog/6582/ultralight-backpacking-pot-cozy/'>how to make an backpacking pot cozy</a>. It sounds like a neat idea, and perfect for me since I plan to eat a lot of Mac-n-Cheese on the hike. So I took a stab at making my <a href='http://photos.thecave.com/Random/DYI-Pot-Cozy/24476733_NV9jrG'>own pot cozy</a> for my <a href='http://www.snowpeak.com/cookware/backpacking/trek-700-titanium-scs-005t.html'>Snow Peak Trek 700 titanium mug</a>. I&#8217;m happy with the end results, but I have yet to test the cozy to see how effective it is. That will be my next project later this week.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rowan has recently been sleeping later into the mornings. This is great because Melanie and I both prefer sleeping in as well. I remember when Rowan first started sleeping through the night. He would wake up at 5:30 in the morning to start his day. I used to say, if only he would sleep until 6 am. And of course he did start sleeping until 6 am over time. When that happened, I starter saying, if only he would sleep until 6:30 am. As he slept later, I continued saying to myself, sleep until 7 am. Then it was 7:30 am. Then 8 am.</p>

<p>He is now consistently sleeping until sometime between 8 and 9 am each morning, and I&#8217;m loving it. But as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. Lucky for me that end doesn&#8217;t come for another year when the kid start kindergarten. Until that time, I&#8217;m going to enjoy the extra sleep.</p>]]></content>

    <id>http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2012/06/18/first-two-trips-with-goruck-gr1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I returned from my second trip using the GR1, and I can now say the <a href='https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3'>Goruck GR1</a> is now my favorite everyday backpack. My latest trip was to WWDC, and the GR1 kicked ass. I packed everything I needed for the week in the ruck, and I used it as my daypack each day at the conference. I especially like how slim the bag is even when stuffed full. I had no problems sliding it in and out from under the seat on the plane. And the zippers are quiet enough when opening and closing as to not disturb those sitting around me at the conference during talks.</p>

<p>Here was my packing list for the conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 T-shirts</li>
<li>A pair of flip-flops.</li>
<li>A paid of Five Finger shoes.</li>
<li>A rain jacket.</li>
<li>A pack towel (don't forget your towel)</li>
<li>A pair of jeans.</li>
<li>Boxes and extra socks (for the sneakers I worn to and from SF)</li>
<li>15" MacBook Pro (circa 2007, not one of those uber cool new ones)</li>
<li>Power supply and extended power cord for the MBP</li>
<li>Ethernet cable</li>
<li>iPad</li>
<li>Headphones</li>
<li>Charging cables, styluses, Square</li>
<li>Tooth brush, toothpaste, deodorant, soap</li>
<li>Beard trimmer and beard comb</li>
<li>Buttons and pins for lanyard flare</li>
<li>Extra field guide</li>
<li>A buff</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I attached a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086UBPDM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0086UBPDM'>Condor H2O pouch</a> to my GR1 to carry my water bottle on the plane ride. And I put the stuff in my pockets (wallet, iPhone, field notes, pen, pocket flashlight, and Fitbit) into the pouch when going through TSA security. I love that I can expand my GR1 as needed like this using the molle webbing. I took the H2O pouch off during the week while attending the conference since my water bottle fit fine in the bag.</p>

<p>The only issue I had was returning home with extra shirts and the WWDC jacket. I didn&#8217;t have the needed space for the extra stuff, so the WWDC jacket and a couple of pairs of boxers went into a sack that I carried. Next year I&#8217;ll remember to leave room for swag on the return trip.</p>

<p>My first trip with the GR1 was to Arkansas with my son to go car camping with my dad, brother, and his son. While the GR1 performed well on this trip, it wasn&#8217;t a good test for me since I was not traveling light on that trip. Most of the gear was checked for the plane ride since it was camping gear. Still, the pack served me well on that trip.</p>]]></content>

    <id>http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2012/05/31/only-9-more-pounds-to-go</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I weighed myself today. I&#8217;m 11 pounds lighter than I was 7 weeks ago, and I&#8217;ve lost a little more than an inch off my waist.</p>

<p>Like most people, I have slowly gained weight over the last 10 years. But that weight gain quickly accelerated after <a href='http://rowanturner.net/'>Rowan</a> was born. I don&#8217;t know how much I have gained since he was born, but I estimate it to be around 15 to 20 pounds. I was the heaviest I&#8217;ve ever been.</p>

<p>And like most people, I have wanted to loss weight. I just don&#8217;t have the time to hit the gym 5 days a week. So how did I lose 11 pounds in 7 weeks?</p>

<p>It started shortly after <a href='http://ideveloper.tv/nsconference/'>NSConference</a>. Drew McCormack <a href='http://twitter.com/drewmccormack/status/185247058398154752'>tweeted</a> that he was under 80kg for the first time in years. What caught my attention was the #4hourbody hash tag. I immediately thought of the book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307465357'>The 4-Hour Workweek</a>, and I thought this hash tag might be related. Turns out, it is. The author of The 4-Hour Workweek wrote another book called <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=030746363X'>The 4-Hour Body</a>.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed The 4-Hour Workweek, I thought the The 4-Hour Body would be nonsense. Still, I added to my wish list as something to read later.</p>

<p>That time came a few weeks later. I wanted something different to read, and thinking about my ever increasing weight I decided to buy The 4-Hour Body. I read through the first part of the book that talks about rapid fat loss. It recommends a diet that is very much inline with what I like to eat. Meat and beans. Lots of meat and beans.</p>

<p>After reading this part of the book, I decided to give it a try. I was already eating chicken and pork daily, but I was also eating ice cream and cereal every day. And my side dishes with my chicken and pork were usually rice or potatoes. I cut out the daily ice cream, and I replaced the cereal with a fried egg. And I replaced my side dishes with beans.</p>

<p>I used to eat lots of beans, but my wife can&#8217;t stand them. So for years, I would only have beans a couple of times a week. Now I have them a couple of times a day.</p>

<p>In addition to the slight change to my daily diet, I decided to hire a personal trainer. For the longest time, I&#8217;ve wanted to get back into a route of go to the gym, but my busy life has made it hard to do. I knew hiring a trainer would motivate me to go, and so far it has worked. I&#8217;ve been going to the gym 1 hour a week since I started this personal challenge.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s what I changed. I cut out daily ice cream, cereal, rice, and potatoes. I added an egg a day, lots of beans, and 1 hour per week at the gym. And as a result, I have lost 11 pounds in 7 weeks. Not the rapid results the book claims can be achieved, but I&#8217;m only loosely following the book&#8217;s advice. In fact, I haven&#8217;t even finished reading the book. I read what foods to eat and not eat then ran with it.</p>

<p>I also kept it a secret that I was on this mission to lose weight. Even my wife didn&#8217;t know for weeks that I was loosely following a diet (though she was noticing the results). That&#8217;s how minor of a change I made with my diet.</p>

<p>The trick for me now is to continue with the weight lost. I want to lose a total of 20 pounds, returning to my ideal weight of 150 pounds. I have only 9 pounds to go (woohoo!). The real fun, however, begins after I hit my goal - keeping the weight off.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img class='alignleft' height='270' border='0' alt='IMG 6146' src='/images/blog/2012-05-30-goruck.jpg' width='180' />
<p>My <a href='https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3'>Goruck GR1 backpack</a> arrived today, and so far I&#8217;m very impressed with it. The construction of this bag is top notch, and the bag screams quality. I love the minimalistic look and it&#8217;s low profile. It is a little stiff coming right out of the box, but it&#8217;s already loosening up after packing and unpacking it a few times and wearing it around the house.</p>

<p>I did a test run packing the GR1, loading it with the clothes (jeans, t-shirts, boxers, socks, rain jacket) and gear (iPad, MacBook Pro 15&#8221;, cables, Bose headphones) I plan to take to San Francisco in a couple of weeks. The GR1 had plenty of space for my stuff with room to spare. The true test, of course, comes this weekend when I take it on a camping trip with Rowan.</p>

<p>I have high hopes for this bag. It will be my go to bag for most things I do, from being my main laptop bag to being the bag I take on short trips (7 days or less - I pack light). There is, however, one change I would make to the GR1.</p>

<p>The front, outside pocket is deep enough to hold my iPad, which makes it great especially for air travel. However, the pocket could be about a half inch deeper. There&#8217;s room on the bag to make this happen.</p>

<p>Other than this one change, the bag appears to suit my needs perfectly, and I&#8217;m very excited to put it to the test this summer.</p>

<p>Side note: Read <a href='http://www.gorucknews.com/gear-explained/gr1-explained-by-jason-goruck%E2%80%99s-founder/'>GR1 Explained</a> for details on the features of this wonderful bag.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in the final stagings of writing my book, and to help out, the wife gave me the okay to spend a few days in Vermont along. No wife. No kid. Just me and my laptop.</p>

<p>The trip to Vermont has, so far, been great. It&#8217;s given me the time I need to make some real progress on the completing the book. It&#8217;s also given me time to do things I don&#8217;t normal get to do anymore.</p>

<p>(Acknowledgement: Yes, I know what follows will likely anger the wife, but hey, I&#8217;m just trying to <a href='http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/2c8c4b3b58/chappelle-show-when-keeping-it-real-goes-wrong-1'>keep it real</a>.)</p>

<p>Things I&#8217;ve done this weekend that I normally don&#8217;t do: <ul>
<li>Write code for hours on end...uninterrupted.</li>
<li>Work the book...uninterrupted.</li>
<li>Go to sleep when I want, but more importantly wake up when I want.</li>
<li>Have hours of peace and quiet. No talking. No socializing with others.</li>
<li>And best of all, take a shower each day.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The combination of sleep and alone time is just want I needed. And the daily showers, icing on the cake.</p>

<p>Thanks Melanie and Rowan for giving me this time.</p>

<p>Update: I do miss having reliable high-speed Internet access.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey! What&#8217;s going on here? A new blog post after more than a year and a half?</p>

<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m slowing getting back into the swing of things, and one of those things is updating thecave.com with my pointless, boring, thoughts.</p>

<p>A lot has happened since that last post in December 2009. My company, <a href='http://whitepeaksoftware.com/'>White Peak Software</a>, has changed directions and is now focused entirely on iOS and Mac OS X development. Rowan has gotten older. And I&#8217;m nearing the end of writing my <a href='http://learnipadprogramming.com/'>first book</a>.</p>

<p>Time will tell if I&#8217;m truly back into the swing of things, but I&#8217;m hopeful I will have more time to post personal rants. Welcome back…to me.</p>]]></content>

    <published>2011-08-15T00:00:00-04:00</published>
    <updated>2011-08-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2011/08/15/salem-the-bike-city</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Salem Mass is often known as The Witch City, but it&#8217;s also trying hard to become a bike city. One example of this comes from today&#8217;s announcement about a <a href='http://www.salemnews.com/local/x850300025/Salem-to-join-major-cities-in-offering-bike-sharing-program'>free bike sharing program</a> here in Salem. The city has also made improvements to off-road bike paths and recently completed the striping of on-street bike lanes. The problem, however, I have with biking in Salem is with the North Shore drivers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve lived and biked in four different cities (and surrounding metro areas): Memphis, St. Louis, New York, and Salem. And of the four I find Salem to be the least bike friendly. The problem isn&#8217;t the city and its attention to bicycling as an alternative form of transportation. The problem is with the annoying, and often times, clueless North Shore drivers in Salem.</p>

<p>Many of these drivers ignore the most basic of driving rules. Left hand turns from the right lane. Right hand turns from the left lane. Pulling out into cross traffic to stop traffic. And stopping the flow of traffic to let an oncoming car turn left. These are but a small example of the poor driving I witness almost daily in and around Salem.</p>

<p>When my wife and I moved to Salem, we thought the Boston area had the worse drivers around. As it turns out, the problem drivers seem to be restricted to the North Shore area only. Family and friends who come to visit are oftentimes shocked at what a North Shore driver will do.</p>

<p>So the randomness of poor driving by North Shore drivers makes Salem a bike unfriendly city. But it doesn&#8217;t stop there. Some of the drivers who don&#8217;t drive like complete idiots think the sidewalk is the place for bicycles. I&#8217;ve been yelled at many times from drivers to &#8220;get off the road&#8221; and &#8220;use the sidewalk&#8221;.</p>

<p>One particular time I was stuck in traffic on Essex Street. A clueless driver driving a van kept stopping. The driver was apparently lost. The street was narrow because of cars parked on the side, so I had to claim my place in the line of traffic. Now mind you, I was riding with traffic. In other words, I was keeping up with traffic and not slowing anyone down. We were only moving about 10 miles per hour, and that&#8217;s when we were moving. Oftentimes we were stopped. The van was making the traffic stop and go. As I said, the driver was lost or even possibly talking on the phone (another rant for another time).</p>

<p>A car squeezes up to me, and the woman driver, apparently nervous to have a bicyclist in front of her, started yelling at me. I told her she should be yelling at the driver of the van ahead of us because it was him causing the traffic problem. And I said it was perfectly legal for me to ride my bike in the lane as long as I obey traffic laws, which I was (and better than she was - she would pull into the oncoming lane just to yell at me). Of course, this woman had to make it her duty to continue harassing me every time the van stopped traffic. I finally had enough of the yelling woman and the crazy van driver, so I rode past the line of traffic and darted down a side street.</p>

<p>This is just one example of the many problems I&#8217;ve had with motorist in the witch city.</p>

<p>I hope Salem continues to promote bicycling in and around the city. I, for one, would like to see this city become more bike-friendly. But I think one part missing from Salem&#8217;s bike strategy is education. Area drivers need to be better educated about the rules of the road.</p>]]></content>

Then finally I decided to search the name of the company attempting to register the .asia domain name. Turns out it is a scam.<br /><br />This scam almost got me.
